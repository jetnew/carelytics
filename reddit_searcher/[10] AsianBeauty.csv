1593926609.0,3,"What’s the best product to prevent oncoming pimples? 

I’ve had oily, acne-prone skin for ages now and it’s gotten much better. Recently I’ve been getting a couple large, painful cystic acne every once in awhile. [This](https://imgur.com/a/bXD51Un) is one gigantic and painful pimple. There’s also a few more rising in the cheek area. So asking r/AsianBeauty for some help here. Which product do you use to prevent these?"
1593937743.0,2,"Skin type:combo (oily t zone and dry cheeks and chin)
Country: Canada
Skin concern: deep physical scarring on cheeks, fungal acne on forehead

Routine
AM
-wash my face with water
-alpha abrutin +HA (from ordinary)
-vitamin C suspension 23% (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 

PM
-cerave foaming cleanser
-glycolic acid toner (from ordinary)
-alpha abrutin +HA
-niacinamide (from ordinary)
-hemi Squalane oil (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 


I recently bought these ordinary products so this routine is new. I am looking add few more products containing BHA or benzyl peroxide but am not sure which ones. While browsing I came across coarx snail mucin which is suppose to help with scaring, but I am not sure if I should purchase it. I am also interested in stridex bha 2% acne pads, de la ruz sulfur ointment treatment and paul’s choice bha 2% exolinat. Again I am not sure which one to incorporate. Please give me suggestions about these products or any other that you have in mind that could help with acne scars or fu gal acne."
1593939243.0,2,"Recently I’ve pared down my routine to just a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, with vit c at night and spf in the morning, but I find my skin feeling tight and dry later on in the day. I would say I have combo/dehydrated skin, and I live on the east coast of the US so right now the climate can be either humid or dry, but pretty hot either way.

AM:

Krave matcha cleanser

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

Purito unscented spf 

PM: 

Krave matcha cleanser

Timeless vit c

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

I’ve been thinking about adding in the hada labo lotion after toner or finding a heavier moisturizer, but I’m scared an actual cream will be too heavy for the summer... any suggestions?"

Hyperpigmentation/scars

I wanted to get the purito defense cleanser and the iunik calming gel. But neither are currently available for me... so any suggestions?"
1593933749.0,1,"Question about lightening acne marks! I tried Shark Sauce and wasn't impressed, should I give it more time (used it twice a day for a little over two weeks)? Or should I switch to something stronger, like Double Shark (does that even make a difference?) I'm not tied to niacinamide either, I've been eyeing vitamin C products too, specifically Melano CC. I just worry about how strong everyone says that is and the possibility of breaking out. Have you used these products? How do you think they compare in their ability to lighten acne marks?"
1593946035.0,1,do you know of any fungal acne safe cleansing oils? I want to use my sunscreen but I don’t have anything to remove it with. Thanks so much !
1593949579.0,1,"Any advice for dark under-eye circles? It seems like no matter how much I sleep, they won’t go away. The best thing I’ve tried so far is a caffeine serum from The Ordinary, but it’s so temporary. I’m hoping for something that has more long-lasting effects. Thanks in advance!"
1593952121.0,1,Hey AB! How often do people extract blackheads? I'm interest to get start into my new products!
1593952242.0,1,"How do you apply mascara properly?  

I bought the heroine make long and curl super waterproof mascara, but honestly no clue if I’m applying it currently. 

Do I curl before or after? Both? I have very straight lashes and they usually seem less curled after I apply the mascara to my curled lashes. 

Any tips?"
1593941946.0,3,"Hi, I'm also in Canada and first of all why are you awake lol its so late!

Anyways, a big tip for your TO products is to switch the application time of your Niacinamide and your Vit C. Idk about you, but the gritty texture of the vitamin c is pretty uncomfortable for the daytime and can affect makeup application, plus the high concentration can cause sensitivity, so it's best used at night. 

If you're looking for benzyl peroxide there's a Canadian-made product called Benzagel which is sold in drugstores/online! Its not AB, but it's cheap and good quality so whatever. 

As for the BHA products, Stridex Pads work pretty well, but you might get irritated at first. However, I'd go for either the Paula's choice or Cosrx bha power liquid or Cosrx bha/aha toner, because I think that the pads in the stridex are such a waste. I see that most of the products in your routine are western skin care brands, and since you are posting in r/AsianBeauty, why not look for some AB products? I know Klairs has a really good Vit C serum, and Cosrx is the best brand to start with, almost all their products are good quality and effective. For treating fungal acne, you should actually use an antifungal shampoo, but you really have to be sure its fungal acne, so I'd say ask a dermatologist."
1593947256.0,1,\^\^It might be good to exchange your toner for an essence! (or simply add an essence to your routine)
1593952094.0,1,2 weeks isn’t enough time. Give it around 3 months. Melano CC isn’t particularly strong compared to 15% L-AA.

1593951115.0,1,"Most probably it's genetic then, or your facial bone structure that is causing the shadow. Unfortunately I doubt any topical can help with that. Make sure you aren't deficient in nutrients too, usually iron deficiency also can cause dark circle - check with your GP for this"
1593952456.0,1,I usually curl it first then use the mascara. I try my best to coat it from the root but make sure to not touch the skin haha. Hope that helps xoxo ♥️
1593942939.0,1,"My sleeping schedule is so messed up I be sleeping in the morning and staying awake at night😂
I am super confused about the order of the products tbh. On the deciem website I was recommended to follow this routine because  apparently you shouldn’t be using glycolic acid and Vitamin C in the same routine. 

I am really interested in purchasing some Cosrx products. Where should I buy them? Is iHerb a good place? 

Thank you so much for the help!"
1593952331.0,1,thanks so much !!
1593943717.0,1,"lmaoo same im basically nocturnal at this point. Anyways I totally overlooked the fact that you have glycolic acid in ur routine, in that case the order you have it rn works too! I actually think you might have too many actives tho, you could maybe do the vitamin c every other day, so that ur able to layer other products without worry about any potential problems. Also, do you use a sunscreen? I dont think i saw it in ur description. 

As for where to buy stuff, iHerb is a pretty good place to get them, if yesstyle shipping prices ever go down then that is a good place too, also sukoshi mart has an online shop now with a pretty good AB selection! Sometimes Amazon and eBay might work too lol.

np and good luck on ur skincare journey :)"
1593945416.0,1,"Yeah I do but I forgot to mention it since i barely go out anymore. 

I heard it is a shady website n imma hella scared to make any purchases from there. People say they had to pay extra taxes or duties after the payment, but many things are on sale right now on there."
1593852537.0,11,"I finally gave in and ordered from yesstyle even though the klairs toner was way overpriced (but cheaper than in my own country) and i was dumb enough to add 1 thing that ships in 21 days. Im already out of the klairs and running out of more stuff so i really don't want to wait. 
Lesson here: always double check the shipping time on yesstyle"

1593898896.0,2,I feel you. 2 weeks ago I placed an order (first time with yesstyle) and didnt realize one product had to wait 7-14 days to ship. Now 15 days later still hasnt shipped and in the product description still says 7-14 days to ship. Im mad at my own stupidity :(

1593895327.0,26,I like the CosRx Centella blemish cream. It seems to really help with getting rid of redness when my pimples start to die down.

1593894399.0,23,"A'pieu madecassoside cica gel. It has no added fragrance or essential oils. I buy it by the 100ml tube! Also, the A'pieu madecassoside Sleeping Mask. Just ordered 2 more of those to make sure I don't run out."
1593893405.0,8,Does anyone know a good toner/essence/serum with centella that’s not skin1004?
1593893914.0,8,"I like the cica creams bc they're super soothing, iope has one, but it's super hard to get now, so I just stick to the klairs midnight blue in the fridge. 

Also the cosrx centella ampoule which is super soothing. Also both the benton deep green tea and isntree green tea toners have cica in them as well and are pretty soothing. 

Side note: Is it me, or is the skin1004 ampoule greasy, I feel like it does nothing?"
1593910615.0,8,I love the Etude House Soonjung Cica Balm. It soothes my acne bumps and heals them really fast after I “accidentally” pops them.
1593896199.0,6,i know cica cream isn't \*exactly\* the same thing but has anyone here tried the dr. jart cicapair? i've seen so many people raving about it and i think my next purchase is going to be either purito or this one
1593902261.0,5,"Has anyone tried Sioris' A Calming Day Ampoule? Looking to try it once I've gone through my last bottle of A'Pieu madecassoside ampoule, but the only drawback is it's almost double the price and haven't heard many reviews on it."

1593923642.0,3,Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner... it also has licorice root and aloe in it as well. Dries down without being sticky.
1593929078.0,3,"Dr. Belmeur Advanced Cica Recovery Cream is great! It's pretty lightweight but does good things for my dry skin especially using it on top of a facial oil (I use squalane)

Sidenote... I just have to say it. Purito sucks as a sunblock. Absolutely sucks! I don't know why everyone here loves it. I feel like people just love the texture (it is very moisturizing) and formula but don't realize it's not very effective. It doesn't last at all. I bought some to give it a shot and wore it out today, reapplying the correct amount (two finger-length lines) and patting it in at appropriate intervals. I got sunburned on my face for the first time in *years*! It's not a bad burn, thankfully, but I was stunned at first. I guess I'm not surprised after seeing that UV camera post that showed how poorly it lasts."

1593950838.0,1,"I knoow right ! But after searching more and since I follow some youtubers who avoid fragrance I found many products without it. If you're looking for a type of product don't hesitate to ask.


For sunscreen I still haven't found my HG but I'm planning to try bioderma ar tinted spf 50. Bioderma is an amazing brand for sensitive skin I aleeady use two of their products. The purito centella unscented spf 50 also has a lot of great reviews."
1593951056.0,1,"Purito UV scented is chemical sunscreen which is why I am still hesitating to get that. I am considering purito comfy block. Ah yes, bioderma is what I am looking at too.

Out of curiosity, do you follow Kelly Driscoll and Dr Dray? I follow them and they have helped a lot!"
1593951601.0,1,"Yes that's why I'm still hesitating too, bioderma is also a chemical sunscreen but the UVA protection is better than purito sunscreens that's why I wanted to try it this summer. And it's also a product that is supposed to be for sensitive skin and anti redness. But I don't know I will try it and let you know if I like it.


Yees hahah that's the youtubers I was talking about 😄 It's dr dray who recommended  bioderma photoderm ar spf in one of her videos."
1593952438.0,1,Yup. I saw that video today 😂 Bioderma is chemical! Oh no! I am still to check out it's ingredients. Please let me know how you like it.

1593858446.0,101,"Recently I decided to incorporate Aquaphor into my routine to help with Tretinoin dryness, because everyone seems to like it (lol). Itching like I have never had before. I thought it was just the usual tret irritation, so kept it up a few more nights until it got to the point I wanted to claw my face off. I thought maybe it was the Lanolin in it, so switched to Vaseline and cut out the tret, thinking the tret was sensitizing my face to the Lanolin. I immediately had the same reaction, except five times worse. I had to wash it all off multiple times within a few hours, it was that unbearable. I cut out all skincare for a few days and am just getting back to applying a bare minimum routine of moisturizer + SPF / tret. I have such sensitive skin, I wish I could be more surprised that I apparently react to petroleum jelly of all things."
1593862232.0,85,"After trying out several AB samples I'd received following some time in the exchange sub, I finally placed one large order for all of the products that were successful samples for me. Then when they all arrived, I started using them all at once. And my skin freaked out. Even though I knew all the products worked for me, starting them all at once was a huge mistake. I stopped using all of them and went back to my original routine then started adding in one new product at a time for at least a week or two before adding the next product into the routine. Please don't be like me. Remember to only add one new product at a time until you know it's ok."
1593855033.0,43,"Cleansing oils (I tried Shu Uemura & Hada Labo) unfortunately broke me out and I continued using for half a year without realizing, switched to Hada Labo to try again but still the same results.

Also accidentally irritated my skin when I had a pimple and applied multiple products (including The Body Shop tea tree oil & 10% benzoyl peroxide) to try to curb it. It still hasn’t fully recovered and I can’t apply even just tea tree oil without irritating it."
1593857039.0,35,"The first time I got into AB I went to some well-reviewed AB-oriented shop and somehow got convinced to spend $200ish on an alcohol-based toner, a meh cleanser, and a moisturizer that all lasted me a month or so.

Nowadays my routine is like 40-50 bucks for 6 months lol."
1593875466.0,16,"I went on a shopping spree and bought a bunch of Paula's Choice serums, and a new hair conditioner (can you guess where this is going?). A few days later I had a full body rash and I started panic removing products from my routine. I was so upset that all these lovely serums would go to waste and I was back to square one... cut to now, a few weeks later, I've tested each serum and found out it was actually the damn hair product. Lesson learned, test all your products!!"
1593849816.0,34,"I’m the type to never really get irritated by any skincare even with fragrance, EOs, etc. and I **used** to just buy anything and everything. Basically my skin isn’t very sensitive. 

Which makes my skincare fails even more INTENSE (for me) because I was so shocked that my skin actually got irritated lol. The first was the SNP animal panda whitening mask. It felt like it was burning but I thought it was part of the ~process~ (yes, my mistake) and after taking it off my face was so red and stingy. I looked tan for like 3 weeks after! 

The Cosrx hydrogel very simple packs irritated my cheeks too but not my forehead for some reason >.<"
1593870226.0,9,"I've gotten used to exfoliating twice a week. I didn't take into consideration that now that I have to wear a mask everyday at work for 8 hours, my face is much more sensitive and irritated (even though it is a soft cotton mask). On top of that, since it is summer my skin is even more sensitive from going to 3 months quarantine with barely any sun exposure to seeing lots of sun everyday. 

But I kept up exfoliating twice a week a long with a million step routine and it made my skin so red, angry and painful. I've finally wisened up and only exfoliate once during the weekend and shorten my routine steps during the week. My face has healed up nicely, although it is still a feat to get through the mask wearing week without pissing my skin off too much."
1593866872.0,9,"Cosrx snail mucin. It worked for me for a whole bottle. Then i buy my 2nd one and it made my skin itchy, red, bumps. I didnt realize that after i use almost half of it."
1593851091.0,17,"Cosrx rice overnight spa mask caused weird bumps between my eyebrows and red spots on my cheeks.

Cosrx holy moly snail mask made my skin dull.

(I still love cosrx as a brand tho)

Round Lab Dokdo cream broke me out horribly.

Missha total ceramide cream gave me closed comedones.

Skin and Lab barrierderm relief balm also caused breakouts ony dry skin.

( I think shea butter and silicone combined don't agree with my skin)

Isntree green tea lotion was too too drying for my dry dehydrated skin.

Purito centella buffet serum and centella suncreen made me realize that bergamot oil irritates my skin and lavender oil irritates my eyes. Good thing they came out with Unscented versions without those essential oils which are now my HG!"
1593861834.0,6,"The Innisfree green tea seed serum was the worst one for me. Horrible rash and swelling that only subsided with hydrocortisone. Still don't know what caused that reaction.

Another one is the Benton cacao cream. Cacao seed butter (comdogenic = 4) in it broke me out really bad and left PIE for like a year."
1593862053.0,6,TO Niacinimide broke my skin out and started horrible breakouts for me even after I stopped using it for a while.

Ithough maybe it was something else so i tried the apieu one too and the same thing happened. Guess my skin doesnt like centella. big sad."
1593859056.0,4,I tried sidmool's niacinamide serum and the ordinary's 10% niacinamide and i find both did.. nothing? I see lots of people with good results from incorporating a good dose of niacinamide in their routine but i didn't see much difference. I also felt like some water-like toners (like roundlab dokdo toner) does absolutely nothing. Cosrx AHA burns my skin barrier away when i'm only using it once a week. Also not exactly a skincare fail but i find makeup goes on blotchy on top of matte sunscreens.
1593861864.0,4,I used benzoyl peroxide 5% I think on my face as a 20yo and then woke up in the morning and lightly wet my face with water the next day. Within 18 hours my skin was full blown chemically burnt and was for over a week.
1593866133.0,3,"Every single product I tried from Purito...

I bought the Snail Mucin Essence, then 1 month later Aloe+BHA toner, then 6 month later the Buffet serum. Every single time my skin immediately turns greasy as hell and small white pimple appear all over my face.   
As soon as I stop using the product, everything goes back to normal.It's really a shame because I love the ethics of this brand, but apparently their products are not for me !

And Granactive retinoids from TO : it immediately lits my face on fire."
1593882161.0,5,"Thinking differin and benzoyl peroxide was the miracle cure for moderate to severe acne, I started caking on benzoyl and differin every day and probably gave myself way worse cystic acne and scars on my left side that was usually pretty clear."
1593884427.0,4,"My skin has been absolutely *terrible* the past few months. I'm not sure what caused everything, but knowing that my skin is already dry, sensitive, and acne-prone while having problems with eczema since I was like 10 or 11 (am 23 now) made me realize that some of the new things I recently tried were pretty dumbass things to do lol.

When quarantine started, I decided it would be a good time to try to use up all of the skincare I had bought and either didn't really like that much or couldn't find a place in my routine to use them due to finding other products that I loved and shared the same purpose. Of course, a lot of those products had fragrance in them, and there were a ton of sheet masks I wanted to use up as fast as possible. *Well, imagine my shock* when my face started getting drier with more acne. Shortly after, I also started getting tiny bumps all over my skin (I still don't know if that's fungal acne or a ton of CCs since it kind of looks like FA but doesn't itch at all, which is why I have a derm appointment at the end of this month). 

I stopped that plan and decided to just use what worked for me while adding in some exfoliating products. I only exfoliated once or twice a week, so I thought maybe I should do more? I only had the Krave Kale-la-lu-yaha glycolic acid and didn't want to use too much of that, so I got the CeraVe SA Renewing cleanser to use every other day. I figured it would be a gentler but more consistent way of exfoliating since I would be washing it off after a shorter time of contact with my skin. I also used the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating cleanser any time I didn't use the SA cleanser (FYI, I only cleanse at night and use a rosewater toner to wipe off any residue in the morning). 

Of course, I then came across the 60-second cleansing method that's supposedly good for any skin type and supposedly saved tons of people's skin. I started using that method when I regularly cleansed at night, but then I saw some people saying you need to do it with all of your cleansing products every morning and night and oil cleanser should be used even if you just wear sunscreen instead of makeup during the day. Three days after double-cleansing at night and cleansing in the morning one time (still switching between the Krave and CeraVe cleansers every other day and using the iUNIK Calendula Complete cleansing oil as my first cleanse at night), I had bumps, dryness, and inflammation all over my face. I had completely destroyed my skin barrier.

I immediately stopped everything I was doing and just used one moisturizer (Benton Deep Green Tea lotion), one sunscreen, (Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF45 PA+++), and one cleanser (Krave). My skin was a lot better after the first week or so, but it was still dry, so I started using the Benton Cacao Moist and Mild cream at night. 

Now that it's been a little over a month, my skin has mostly gone back to normal. I still have some pustules, the maybe/maybe not FA, and some dryness (which is mostly because I've been crying for like a week since we found out one of our cats is in liver failure and we have to put her down in two days 🙃 2020 is the worst year), but my skin overall seems to be in better condition. Last week, I started using TO Niacinamide again to see if it would help the maybe/maybe not FA and to just finish it off because I actually hate the texture of it and feel like it makes my face 10x drier. The bumps on my forehead have reduced a little, so I'm going to finish off products I'm using right now and use the two products I have that are FA safe: Hada Labo Gokujyun Moist lotion and Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing gel (still gonna use the Krave cleanser, and I just bought like three bottles of the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented sunscreen before finding out it wasn't FA safe, so I'm still gonna use those). I'd buy more FA safe products and treatments now, but I'm still not sure that I actually have FA and am kinda afraid to try anything too intense because of my chronic eczema.

On the bright side, I've almost completely eliminated fragrance from my routine."
1593888589.0,4,The COSRX snail essence that I once bought because I wanted to nourish my skin but really just clogged my skin and broke me out like mad 😭

1593861392.0,3,I don't have sensitive skin and considered myself one of the lucky ones who can put any type of product on their face and it works. So imagine my utter horror when Neutrogena hydroboost caused a massive itchy acne breakout on my face which disappeared the day after I stopped using it. It was crazy and I was completely disappointed. Now I stick to aloe vera :/
1593879785.0,3,"Niacinamide sensitivity? - read so much positive feedback about this ingredient, had really high expectation. 

Tried a couple of times to incorporate it into my routine. First with TO 10% + zinc, then again with a K-beauty toner Rovectin and Olay regenerist which both has niacinamide listed pretty high on the ingredient list. I didn’t use them all at once, only a couple of drops and tried them all separately with no layering involved so basically my routine was just salicylic acid wash, any of the above followed by a light moisturiser. 

Every single time I get tiny white bumps all over my forehead, cheeks, everywhere the day after."
1593884229.0,3,Not AB but i used the Ordinary’s niacinamide and zinc serum for like three months before realizing it was breaking me out 😭 i was so disappointed since I only ever hear people talking about how it helped them so much lol.
1593899627.0,3,"My most glorious fail was using the Cosrx Snail Essence and Mizon snail BB cream. 

I bought them because I heard sooo many rave reviews online, I have always had issues with dry skin so thought they'd work well. Initially bought the BB cream and loved it, however after a while I started experiencing breakouts. Didn't really think much of it. Some time later I bought the Cosrx essence, and that is when (for a lack of a better term) sh*t hit the fan. The essence worsened my breakouts to the point where I was experiencing borderline cystic acne and I stupidly used the products in conjunction for a long time. At some point I must have put two and two together and stopped using them and lo and behold, my skin cleared up. At some point I tried to use the essence again and immediately after first use I broke out so needless to say I yeeted that thing straight in the bin. Haven't used snail products since (about two years now) and I have never had anything like this happen again.

One thing I since realised in hindsight- when I first bought the Mizon BB cream, my mum told me she tried using a snail cream in the past but she was allergic and had to stop using it. I stupidly thought it wouldn't apply to me so went ahead with using the products mentioned. What a mistake!!

Sorry for the long comment but yeah ... Just because a product is popular and works wonders for a majority of the people, doesn't mean it will work for you..! I leaned that the hard way lol"
1593905366.0,3,I tried going to a facialist for peels for an entire year only to discover that what my skin likes best is being entirely left alone except for a $4 Korean madecassoside cream and a retinol. I spent $170 a peel once a month for a year to discover that my skin looks a hell of a lot better if I keep most acids away from it.
1593876703.0,4,"My skincare boo-boo was when I used extra virgin olive oil on my face as my makeup remover. I had large, painful pimples as a result. Everyday, there was a new pimple forming. I couldn't even look in the mirror because of how ugly I felt that time. My mother then accompanied me to a derma and my skin problem was solved. I will never ever use extra virgin olive oil on my face again!"

I used it for a little while two separate times, and each time after a couple consistent days of usage my small red dots appear on my face. When I stopped using it a couple days later the dots disappeared. I wasn’t sure if it was because of the serum or my terrible sleep schedule at the time, so I tried using it again and the same thing happened. Quite disappointed. Never again."
1593868749.0,2,"never ever try Madeca Derma Cream, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you're a beginner in skincare. I saw it from a Filipina vlogger she was so confident that the product is like a magical cream, she even invited people to testify the product's effectivity in her channel to prove that it really works🙄, she also recommended to just keep using it even if you're breaking out from it saying that its normal because you'll experience purging. I paired madeca with cetaphil cleanser, garnier micellar water(pink) and belo whitening sunscreen, it's impossible that the breakout was from these products because i was using it way before i tried madeca. Overall madeca only worsened my skin condition, i thought the micro-peeling effect was a good sign, i didnt know that its already damaging my skin barrier,  i was a beginner in skincare so i was so naive and got swayed easily lol, i didnt even read the ingredients list because i trusted it so much, denatured alcohol was the top ingredient of madeca and it also consist of shea butter, and a bunch of different essential oils, basically it has all the worst ingredients that you can think of lol. I used to idolize that filipina vlogger bc her skincare reviews and makeup tutorials are always on point and she seems very credible lol, but lesson learned never trust anyone but experts(Hyram is counted lol)."
1593873256.0,2,Using cyspera in the morning then washing it off and adding acids after that. I got a headache and puked tons after that. Now the stench from cyspera reminds me of puke. It really stinks. I really discourage anyone from using it on your face. The smell is soooo hard to wash off. Probably better for pigmentation on other areas of your body.
1593875315.0,2,"Months ago i tried the Purito centella buffet serum. I had high hopes and my skin looked fantastic for a couple of days, then i started breaking out in tiny blisters that turned into pimples that wouldn't heal. Apparently that high a concentration of centella asiatica sensitized me to that ingredient and now i can't use anything with centella without breaking out in little allergic blister pimples. Had to stop using several products i really liked because my skin suddenly won't tolerate them."
1593876661.0,2,"When I was reading this I was wondering if I wrote this, lol. Same here. I purchased this two the ordinary products and they gave me allergic reaction with red bumps and such an uncomfortable irritation. I didn’t use anything else new in my routine apart from them. And rest of the products in my routine, are working for me for quite sometime now. These products are so popular, Im sure they are working fine for many but Im glad to know Im not alone."
1593880714.0,2,"The Cosrx snail mucin was my first AB product ever. I was so excited to try it because it had such amazing reviews. One week later I had broken out with the WORST cystic acne since I was a teenager. Then I went down the rabbit hole of using harsh products like the Dr. Dennis Gross peeling pads and clay masks. I ended up going on meds. It’s been a couple of years but I still flinch when I see people talk about snail products. The Cosrx sent me down a very misguided path and I learned about skincare the hard way. I wish I had known that YMMV and to start slow! (Also, I read that there may be a correlation between dust mite allergy and sensitivity to snail products?? Whaaaaat.)"

1593884056.0,2,"It was around five years ago during my first year of living the AB lifestyle. I had heard so many good things about vitamin C so I decided to incorporate it into my routine, which was still mostly in trial mode as I was working on finding the most efficient products for my skin. So I ordered the C20 vitamin C serum and started using it, if I remember correctly I didn't rush it, took it slow. 

My skin seemed to be okay with it at first, but not long after I started to get huge angry pimples on my cheeks and chin. No idea why I didn't immediately suspect the latest new product, I guess I really wanted to believe in it. At some point I had a disgusting trio of the ugliest biggest pimples on my right cheek a centimeter from my nose. You can imagine how horrified I was, but no matter what I did, they wouldn't go away. I had never before had any sort of breakout on my cheeks before that, even during my teens only my T-zone was ever affected. 

I fought hard, even got several very specific products to fight them, such as Cosrx Asol, lots of blemish patches and ointments, but they kept on coming and always appeared in the same area. At some point I gave up and accepted my fate, but then I suddenly ran out of my vit C serum and luckily hadn't ordered a new one yet. Lo and behold, after going without for an amount of time my skin cleared up and ever since that time I haven't had any breakouts on my cheeks. At that point I finally made the connection between vitamin C serum and the breakouts so I have steered clear of vitamin C since then."
1593895331.0,2,"Last night I applied a pea sized blob of the Uruoi Deep Moisture Gel that I just purchased and it felt great. Until I went to bed that is, it stayed fairly tacky/sticky and I had applied it down my neck too, so I kept sticking to my pillow. Perhaps it is a daytime only moisturizer for me now.

My long-term, never again, not in a million years fail is the CosRX Galactomyces Essence. Triggered a seborrheic dermatitis flare with rashes on my face that would migrate in patches (left cheek to right cheek, forehead, down the sides of my face, etc) and I didn't know what was going on for several months, and it was hot, red, and scaly. It's caused by the same yeast as fungal acne, so I had to adopt an FA-safe routine and it finally cleared up. Took about a year to resolve actually and I was very afraid of oils in any skincare item for a long time. It's been about 4 years now and I'm only now cautiously trying a few oils in my routine again. The Uruoi product mentioned above is one of them. No fermented ingredients (namely galactomyces) for me!"

1593919833.0,2,"Definitely over-exfoliating my face and not even knowing it was a thing! 

Started off (3 years ago!) with bumps on my forehead before I went on holiday to Jordan which is extremely hot. While I was there, I wanted to try and get an acne cream so I bought the first thing I saw which was tret as I didn't have much knowledge into how strong these acne treatments were and it was easily bought otc. I cringe everytime I think of this but I would use this EVERYDAY without spf and go into the hot sun to tan. This started making things noticeably worse. In hindsight, I think it was fungal acne fed by the heat and products I was using however I didn't even know that was a thing at the time.

I didn't even realise the damage I'd done and the over-exfoliation led to a constant cycle of more spots on my forehead which I tried to tackle with even more harsh products. My routine  then consisted of a salicylic acid cleanser with one of those even harsher spin brushes, glycolic acid pads straight after, and then benzoyl peroxide! I want to cry everytime I remember this routine. Sometimes I'd even add in a cheeky st ives or overnight glycolic acid mask. My face kept deteriorating, it was always red and it actually looked like leather at one point. It was shiny, but so dry to the touch I felt like I could see my reflection in it and at the time there wasn't much on over-exfoliation so I didn't even realise what the problem was. 

Needless to say I was fighting a losing battle with my skin for the last 3 years because even after I found out my moisture barrier was absolutely destroyed, it was impossible to find products that would heal it without clogging pores and feeding fungal acne. It was a nightmare. But yeah, think it's finally on the mend lol"

I blame the fragrance, but honestly I don't know why it happened. But it encouraged me to switch to AB products, so all's well that ends well, I guess. 

More recently, my Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel waterproof sunscreen seems to have caused some huge, irritated red bumps on my temple, along with other scattered pimples. I really like this stuff, so I'm going to give it another go and hope it's just a matter of cleansing more thoroughly since it's waterproof.

Their Green Tea Fresh Toner is great and I really love it; can't get enough of it. I substituted the Benton Deep Green Tea Lotion for the Isntree one and it's a great lightweight moisturizer for oily skin.

Last summer I bought the Neogen Real Ferment Micro Serum and was so excited and had high expectations, but I didn’t patch test and it made me break out. A few weeks later I patch tested it and yep, breakout confirmed. Thankfully I was able to return it. 

A couple summers ago I finally started using the Hada Labo Premium Gokujyun lotion and while I can’t 100% scientifically prove it was that, ha, my lips got SO dry and dehydrated, to the point where it hurt to smile. They started to get better when I stopped the Gokujyun and now I just use it as a mix in for my body lotion."

I wasn’t using it daily because I sometimes never left the house during the day due to the nature of my job (I know, I know).

Now that I’m wearing the Timeless and Shiseido together consistently, I broke out all along the lower half of my face. I haven’t broken out in probably over a year now so I was kind of bummed. The part that made me laugh the most was editing my recent YouTube video (where I talk about skincare) and hearing myself say “as you can see, my skin has been doing really good lately” in reference to my consistent routine for over a year now. I have no idea what is breaking me out since I used both separately without much of an issue and all of a sudden I have a mountain range on my face. Sucks, but hopefully it goes away soon."

One of the tips there was to remove mineral makeup using extra virgin olive oil. I thought that was a hard rule when it comes to mineral makeup usage. :P"
1593918260.0,1,Oh yes I’ve used elta MD and using purito mineral sunscreens and they haven’t broken me out!! But they both have some level of pilling. Do any of those not pill?
1593898162.0,2,"There’s a lot of overlap in many of the items! But I do notice some differences in some of the hype products. 

In Korea the Round Lab Dokdo line has been pretty raved about, especially the toner. But I think people here enjoy this as well. Round Lab’s Birch Juice line is also gaining some traction, especially their moisturizing cream and UV sun cream. Something I don’t see often here from Round Lab is their 365 Derma Relief Sun Cream. It’s a highly rated sunscreen in Korea but rarely do I see it talked about here. 

Also, Be Plain Chamomile Toner and their Cicaful Ampoule is raved about. I see these a bit on here though. One thing I noticed is a lot of calming and soothing ingredients are focused on in Korea. Repairing the skin barrier was huge for a while.

Something I don’t see here as often is The Lab by Blanc Doux. Their Hyaluronic Toner was quite a craze a while ago after Director Pi on Youtube suggested it. It apparently has different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid so it’s more effective at locking in moisture. 

Another big brand in Korea that I rarely see here is Sidmool. A lot of their products are highly rated, especially their moisturizers and hydrating products. Unfortunately I can’t seem to find them anywhere online for international shipping :( 

FYI - I probably missed a lot and this list might be a little outdated! Director Pi on Youtube has had a huge impact on Korean skincare and how people purchase products. She puts english subs on most of her videos too so, maybe try checking her out for more product info!"
1593896136.0,1,I’m worried that my skin has developed a sensitivity to chemical sunscreens because I tried a couple other ones without fragrance and they burned too :(
1593882708.0,2,It is OK to use them together. I mix Niacinamide and vitamin C all the time. In fact Paula's Choice call it a 'winning combination'. With exception of TO because of their own formulation
1593883060.0,3,Do you put on anything under cicaplast ?
1593866689.0,11,I'm the same! I can't use oil cleansers as they irritate my skin like no other. I can only use micellar water and gel or foam cleansers to double cleanse.
1593868834.0,6,Ok thanks. I wear mineral sunscreen and my micellar water just doesn't quite seem to remove it thoroughly. I'm still looking for that magic non clogging cleanser but maybe it's just my skin haha
1593891614.0,1,I'm also the same! Been using micellar water and still on the hunt for that good cleansing oil but haven't had any luck yet. Damn sensitive skin
1593880404.0,1,"I probably read it from articles for rosewater, about how it has almost no side effects compared to other essential oils like teatree oil etc, and when I checked TBS's tea tree oil review for my country, many report breakouts. I am thinking of getting Mario Badescu drying lotion for spot treatment; have you tried it?"
1593861126.0,15,"Let me guess... you also have perfect skin and never break out? There really is something to having a pared down, simple routine. Starting to realise less is probably more when it comes to skincare.

My bf also uses Hada Labo (he took it from me) over a water facial mist along with a Biore sunblock I bought him for daytime. At night he just washes his face with water and he uses my Cosrx gel face wash whenever he feels ""a little oily,"" which is every two weeks or so -_- That's it, and he practically has no visible pores or skin problems to speak of."
1593937039.0,1,please add SPF to your skincare routine....
1593896203.0,2,Is it normal to purge every time with aha/bha? I always get little bumps after aha that go away after a day. I’m not sure what to think of them as they aren’t true pimples.
1593866029.0,4,"it might be 1,3-propanediol. if your skin1004 ""100% centella"" ampoule is 90% 1,3-propanediol, 10% centella extract powder, that would certainly explain why you have issues with it.  a lot of these diols and glycols are well tolerated at low concentrations but not high.

i have it, too, and i would choose a different carrier."
1593937729.0,1,"Hi! Currently I only use TO products for PM routine; so I start immediately with the Niacinamide, and then AA, and then Innisfree's cream spread thinly. :D"
1593922212.0,2,"I didn't buy it to use as a hydrating layer, I'm just using it as a hydrating layer, given that it can't serve any other purpose in my routine (I have other products that I prefer for the other stuff it's supposed to do)"
1593887629.0,1,I see! I’ve also been thinking about trying it (with oil during the night and on its own in daytime cuz I also use sunscreen). My face is oily naturally and it doesn’t get dehydrated easily so I have some hope. Thanks for the reply!
1593932445.0,1,"Interesting. Yeah hyaluronic acid generally works with most skin types altho some particular products can cause reactions. For example, I love the Habo Lado Gokujyun Moisturizing Lotion, but I have read from some people on here that it made them break out. So not sure if it’s the formulation or other ingredients, or 🤷🏻‍♂️

And where do you live? Generally Amazon is an all-around solid choice that can sometimes net you much lower prices than from Asian boutiques or even a product’s actual brand website. But it’s also frustrating because not all AB products are on Amazon."
1593918352.0,2,I haven’t experienced pilling. Could vary by skin type though. I am oily.
1593900112.0,1,"Hmm, that may be the case. When we slather chemical sunscreen on our faces daily, I feel like eventually we'll develop sensitivities. It's a fine line :/ Also, the burning may be happening if your moisture barrier is compromised. Just a thought!"
1593887003.0,1,"Some nights I cleanse, then Clindamycin (topical liquid form), then Cicaplast, then tretinoin. Some nights I flip the order of the tret and Cicaplast.

I haven’t tried Cicaplast in the morning yet, as I’m not sure how it will interact with my Vitamin C serum, sunscreen, and makeup. It might make my face too dewy for daytime? Not sure!"
1593872804.0,11,"Feels rare to find more people with cleansing oil intolerance! Cleansing oils are always touted as THE ultimate double cleansing product, sucks that I can’t reap all the benefits."
1593902325.0,3,"I get irritated from oil and balm cleansers that emulsify and rinse off with water. My skin would always feel tight and dry, but I realised it was happening only after rinsing off. I’ve started just wiping it off with a tissue before going in with a gentle second cleanse to get the remainder off and that seems to solve the issue. It seems a little counterintuitive since the main appeal of these new generation oil cleansers is that they do rinse clean, but boy something in that mechanism dried my skin out so much. In future I might just switch to oil cleansing with a traditional oil and since I’m using my second cleanser to do the emulsify and rinse part anyway."
1593872696.0,1,Perhaps adding a toner step with cotton pad to hydrate + wipe off any residue could help? It’s what I do too but I never find any residue. I use hada labo deep clean & blemish face wash if that helps. Good luck finding the perfect products for you!
1593866644.0,4,I wonder if girls can do less routine too ><
1593872515.0,1,Wow I wasn't aware of both of these things. Thankyou so much!
1593906186.0,1,"i see, then i might consider trying out those powdered centella and just mixing a bit with my toner to check.ty"
1593873794.0,7,"I'm actually surprised too, I've never expected other people to have the same experience as I do with oil cleansers. It's so universally liked and talked about. Yes, I totally get what you mean, I'm always super jealous of people for being able to use oil cleansers, especially when they talk about how easy it is to use, the pore cleaning action (grits), etc."
1593872897.0,7,"Tbh I scaled my routine back a ton after a few years of going berserk with skincare and my skin has been happier for it.

I am lucky that i overall have decent skin. It’s very tolerant of new items and i don’t get significant acne unless there’s a real trigger.

My only real issues are old acne scars from the dark ages, largeish pores, and minor fine lines (I’m in my 30s). So I have maybe 2-3 actives that I use. Vitamin c a few times a week, retinol nightly, and SA when my skin gets rough (maybe a few times a month if that).

I cut out all the rest of the experiments and haven’t had any negative affects by doing so"
1593894055.0,3,You need to do what works for your skin. I spent a decade on variations of very minimal routines. My 8 step routine has been transformative for my skin. If I try to scale back on anything my skin back slides in some way.
1593872656.0,1,"Yes, they definitely can. I'm trying to simplify my current skincare routine because I see people getting great results with far less than I'm using. I think simpler products with less ingredients are key. All the potential chemicals and stuff I'm layering on is starting to concern me as I've had contact and seborrheic dermatitis in the past, likely from compromising my skin's natural barrier."
1593899490.0,1,What type of skin do you have?
1593891178.0,2,Wym by “potential chemicals”? Everything is a chemical
1593911121.0,1,"Sensitive, acne prone, and very dehydrated. Pulling back on layers of hydration results in a lot of oil compensation and closed comedones. It’s a balancing act of trying to keep my skin hydrated and calm while also encouraging the cell turnover needed to keep pores clear."
1593892258.0,2,Chemicals that trigger allergic reactions if it wasn't clear

1593884408.0,46,"Melano cc! There’s a reason it’s an HG for many people on this sub. Tons of reviews on it already but for me, it’s the only vit C product which has visibly improved my skin in a relative short time frame (I’ve tried OST, Klairs, Wishtrend, Glossier, TO). My old PIH have faded noticeably, new acne scars aren’t as red. The packaging is also genius, don’t really have to worry about oxidation I find!"
1593885052.0,10,"Wishtrend! Its the most effective thing for my skin. I wish the melano cc worked for me like others as I like the packaging and how it doesn't oxidize, but it did nothing for me."
1593906892.0,4,"Shark Sauce in the Great White Shark variety! Vitamin C, niacinamide, licorice, and sea kelp!"
1593909442.0,5,"Neogen real vita C powder! I mix it into my toner in the morning. Nice for traveling and you don’t have to worry about it oxidizing. It is grainy unless you let it sit in your liquidy product for a couple of minutes. I have pretty hearty skin for vitamin C though - for sensitive skin, encapsulated vitamin C may be better. (Also Melano CC for sure! )"
1593906450.0,3,I've been using klairs vit drop! So far I've found it helps lighten my belmishes and helps with texture
1593899011.0,2,has anyone tried the Rhoto C serum? i don’t have experience with vitamin c and want to start with something affordable and effective. i’m 27 and am starting to see a tiny bit of sun damage and want something brightening.
1593912023.0,1,"Innisfree Brightening Pore Serum! It helped my acne scars fade away to faintly visible within a month, plus it has hyaluronic acid which helps with hydration."
1593919308.0,1,"I have sensitive skin so I cant handle pure vitamin c . I found this amazing substitute called Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening Serum. It contains a lot of vitamins, not just vitamin c due to the sea buckthorn. Also has niacinamide too :)

 perfect for sensitive skin!"
1593922176.0,1,"Melano CC was kinda meh for me, but  2sol Facial Recovery Booster is delivering. Its also go 10% niacinamide and Panthenol so I'm killing multiple birds with one stone."
1593937210.0,1,"i really want to try out the Melano cc but im still currently using PURITO vitamin C serum. Thoughts of Purito's one is when i first started using it oh damn my acne scars on my face really lighten. It has really helped me slowly but surely improve acne scars and dark spots. One thing that you might not like about the PURITO one is that is has a strong and not very pleasant smell. There is no fragrance in the formulation, so it has a somewhat strange smell, when i started using i was really put off by it, but as time goes im slowly getting used to it."
1593901284.0,-8,AB doesn't make good vitamin c serums. I would recommend formulas with published studies of efficacy such as skinceuticals or timeless
1593910553.0,9,This didn’t work for me. Read quite a number of reviews that this causes breakout so tried avoiding it but saw it on sale 2 months ago in a local store so tried it. Tried on some spots to see what’s the rave about. Gave 3 days gap on each usage to slowly intro to my routine. Only used it twice and my face say no bro. This is the first product for me that causes breakout.
1593886555.0,6,THIS. I love Melano CC
1593892437.0,7,I honestly couldn’t believe how well it works compared to the many other (even more expensive!) brands I’ve tried.
1593907051.0,6,"I just started using it two weeks ago and the glow is real.

I used to use TO 20% but I hated the texture so much I rarely used it. So maybe I will finally see some results with actual consistent use. I like the Yusuf scent too and the oily texture lets it sink it quickly after washing my face."
1593909262.0,3,Hi! I’m wondering which product you use? I’m just hearing about this and when I look it up it seems like there’s a lotion and essence
1593935306.0,1,"100% this! I love melano cc, helps reduce scarring marks from acne. Also  im based in singapore and the type that is available in stores here has alcohol in it, which is not effective for me at all! So make sure to check the ingredients before purchasing."
1593887347.0,4,It dint work for me .. dint see any improvement at all after 6 months too.. now changed to timeless vitamin c 2 weeks back. Seems to be good so far but would be good to wait for few more
1593895794.0,3,Good point! Products work differently for different people! ☺️
1593903984.0,1,Do you use the 21.5% or the 15%+ Ferulic Acid+Niacinamide one?
1593909814.0,2,Make sure you don't take so long to finish the bottle because it oxidizes so easily in our climate. I wasted half a bottle. Huhu. I think buying the smaller size is wiser?
1593911120.0,1,I feel you on that... you want it to work for you as well as it did for others but your skin just says nope 😢 But you won’t know how it works for you until you try!
1593910962.0,6,It’s the essence that most talk about! Look for the thin silver tube!
1593911224.0,2,"I was the exact opposite! Tried Timeless 20% for over 6 months without results, but saw noticeable improvements with Melano CC in a number of weeks. Heads up that the Timeless is STRONG, and it may take some time to work up to daily use."
1593904031.0,2,The 21.5%.
1593944502.0,1,"I’ve had mine for over a year and it still hasn’t oxidised!! I keep the bottle inside the original box in the fridge. 

A lot of people don’t keep it in the box but I think that’s important because I read that the light from the fridge can cause it to oxidise quicker"
1593911224.0,1,I've only started using it for two months I think? So haven't seen anything strange. But thank youu will kept that in mind. I found that happened to my niacinamide from the ordinary
1593938887.0,1,I have it for almost 2 months and a half now and it has the same colour and consistency. I keep it in the fridge and I don't use it so often now that it's warmer. Maybe once a week. But I used it 2-3 times a week when it was colder and  I guess because I didn't open it so often little air got in and it was better preserved. Also the fridge part.
1593911117.0,2,Thanks a ton

1593917399.0,3,I found Clio Kill Black better than Dollywink or Heroine Make but that I haven’t tried much except those three
1593923841.0,2,"Kate makes an amazing eyeliner,  Super Sharp Liner EX. I've tried pretty much every great eyeliner and one one handles the best and creates a film, so it doesn't transfer (also hooded lids here). it's blacker than Dollywink, which is my second fave."
1593926429.0,1,Flowfushi’s Moteliner or their newer Uzu liners

1593953146.0,1,"I second this. Clio is the winner. Never smudge, perfect tip and good longevity. During the super hot summer days it does smudge a littleee bit but surely 10x better than Urban Decay imo."
1593895839.0,20,This is possibly my worst nightmare
1593927349.0,14,"For what it's worth, I think the reason people with basic routines have good skin is because people who have naturally good skin wouldn't have elaborate routines in the first place. I hope that made sense?

As for my simple routine, it would be oil cleanser, moisturiser, SPF."
1593904503.0,13,"If it’s only three products, then there’s no room for anything except oil cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen, for obvious reasons. Those who use the most basic probably have no issues to tackle in the first place, hence just cleanse, hydrate and protect.

After watching skincare on those with FP4 and higher, I decided to revamp and rearrange my routine to minimize irritation while battling sun spots. However, without my various prescriptions, it’ll look like this:

AM: water rinse, P20 Kids sunscreen 

PM: Chifure Washable Cold Cream, Zeroid Intensive Oint-cream or Eucerin Roughness Relief 10% urea"
1593899790.0,9,"My picks would be CosRx Good Morning Gel Cleanser, Purito Unscented Centella Sunscreen and Iunik Beta Glucan moisturizer (if I could also use a summer moisturizer i'd choose La Roche Posay Toleriane Sensitivo Fluide). Those three things could very well be my whole routine and I wouldnt miss anything essential."
1593896881.0,6,"Hada Labo foaming cleanser, Hada Labo Perfect Gel, and Skin Aqua UV super moisture gel. Those give me everything I need, and for my oily skin those three are good for both summer and winter. Ideally I’d add in DHC Deep cleansing oil for a double cleanse, but I don’t find this sunscreen difficult to remove with just the 1 cleanse. Anything else is nice but not absolutely necessary. Easy peasy :)"
1593912643.0,3,"My skin care is simple. I don't want to buy or do too much to my skin when I don't need to.

I use a cleanser, vitamin c, moisturizer then sunscreen. It's 4, but gotta use sunscreen.

PM cleanser, retin-a, moisturizer. 

I'm more focused on using what I have vs buying new stuff."
1593898950.0,2,"illi total again care cleansing oil (discontinued so idk - a cleansing oil that doesn’t leave a film?), zeroid intensive lotion, nivea uv milky gel"
1593915778.0,2,"I honestly LOVE it. I have combination acne prone skin and it doesn’t break me out ( miracle ). This toner is probably a little too hydrating in the humid summer here, but it’s so soothing I keep using it. I haven’t tried anything else by Round Lab, but I really want to now !

**Skin Type:** dry/very dry skin

**Skin Concerns:** overall dry skin due to tret

**Skin Goals:** Hydrated, bouncy, firm, glowy skin

I get all my asian skincare on Yesstyle. I try to stick to fragrance free and alcohol free skincare as much as I can.

**Routine AM**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash -**    a very, creamy and hydrating face wash. Removes any leftover oil    cleanser and remaining makeup I may have on my face. Simple and    effective, been using this for years now and buy in bulk from Holland    & Barrett.

**Purito Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence -**    this is my fourth re-buy! It's really very hydrating and has   noticeable   brightening effects. The texture is slightly thick - it   does not run   through my fingers so it's not watery. I just press it   into my skin  before applying the emulsion. It's really a very good   essence!

**The Plant Base Nature Solution Hydrating Bamboo Emulsion -** a nice layer of dewy moisture as a prep to the rest, which is exactly what my skin needs.

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream -**    super dewy and super moisturising, holds really well under my   concealer  as well. Slightly sticky texture and has some fragrance in it   but it's  the last ingredient on the list and is not overpowering at   all.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream -**    I use the same moisturiser day and night as I have very dry skin due   to  using tret for anti-ageing purposes. This one is a dream I want to   it  eat it. It's truly hydrating and has the most gorgeous texture.  Dewy   finish.

**Canmake    Tokyo Mermaid UV Gel SPF50 PA++++ or Purito Green Level Unscented Sun    SPF50 PA++++ or Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Moisture Cream SPF 30 -**    I alternate between the three sunscreens depending of whether I'm    inside (SPF 30), outside dry day (Purito) or outside humid day    (Canmake). All three sunscreens are broad spectrum, fragrance and    alcohol free and no white cast. All three have semi-dewy and dewy    finishes, zero white cast. I'm tanned/medium brown so I love these.

**Routine** **PM**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil -**    a thick yet runny enough oil specific for dry skin. Easily removes    makeup and sunscreen and lathers into milk. Washes off clean and leaves    no residue.

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream**

**A-Ret Gel 0.025% -**    gel form, spreads nicely on skin and works wonders. I've been using    retinols for a long time and started using tret last year for    anti-ageing. The upgrade is serious and my skin is like glass with this    bad boy.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream**

**On No Tretinoin Routine PM:**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**REN Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic -**    contains some fragrance but again low on the ingredients list. I    saturate cotton pad and press it in all over my face and neck. I use the    leftover on my legs, helped with my strawberry leg a ton and my legs    are all glowy I kid you not! Has mild exfoliating properties which  helps   with my flakes from the tret. Skin is all a-glow!

1593790766.0,12,"How do you manage to minimize the irritation when using tret and the Ren AHA? I use tret too and I wanna add an exfoliant so bad, but I’m scared of damaging my moisture barrier"
1593792000.0,7,How did you reduce the irritation from Ren? I have eczema so I have dry and sensitive skin but man this would irritate my skin for a few minutes idk if that’s normal
1593800088.0,4,Does the canmake sunscreen lean more to the matte or dewy side? I currently use the purito unscented spf and thats a dewy finish
1593803536.0,3,Have you thought about putting the tretinoin on after your moisturizer to reduce dryness? I heard that’s quiet popular.
1593792933.0,2,"love the purito fermented complex essence too! it's a really nice texture and not irritating for my oily comedogenic-prone skin at all :) one of my best finds from online shopping during lockdown, lol"
1593788903.0,1,Thoughts on the Sukin cream?
1593796319.0,1,Although I’m located in US wanted to know where do you purchase your A-retinol from ?
1593796820.0,1,"Oh, I really want to try the Dr. Organic face wash, Scinic eye cream, and Sukin night cream. I'm always trying to find very moisturizing, fragrance free skincare."
1593799373.0,1,Is the Sukin cream really good ?
1593804990.0,1,Can I ask where you got the can make and Purito sunscreens from please?? I’m moving to the UK in the next few months and want to make sure I can get them :)
1593806123.0,1,I have been eyeing the **Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream** .  I was waiting for reviews to try it.  Sounds like you really like it.
1593820029.0,1,Did you have to get the A Ret gel 0.025% prescribed to you?
1593817334.0,2,I have REN and wow I’m definitely gonna try it on my legs also.
1593799180.0,5,"I don't use tret every night. One night I use tret, and one night I use REN. I need it because my skin flakes with the tret. However, I believe the REN is gentle enough for daily use on its own, so I doubt it would wreck your skin barrier if you follow with a good serum, moisturiser etc. I normally finish my REN night routines with a face oil as an occlusive too. Other than the tret flakes from time to time, my skin is super healthy and bouncy."
1593798595.0,4,"I would avoid that Ren toner if you have eczema because I do and used it once a day for 3 days straight and I got the worst skin irritation. It was bumpy, itchy and irritated for awhile and my skin is still textured from it. And I never get eczema on my face! My derm told me to use cortisone cream to fix it. 10/10 would not recommend"
1593799017.0,2,Yes I do get slight tingly/prickly feeling on my skin for a few seconds but it goes away after that. I even feel it when I apply it on my legs haha! My skin is more dry than sensitive though so maybe it's a bit worse for you? :(
1593802270.0,3,I would say a semi-dewy finish. More like a 'natural' skin finish.
1593804056.0,2,"Yes I used to do that and I also used to mixed the tret with my moisturiser and then apply it on. But I built up tolerance over the years and now apply it straight to my skin and just buffer it with moisturiser on top after five minutes. My skin is not crazy flaky anymore, it's past that point but it still flakes from time to time so I just gotta keep on top of it."
1593798946.0,2,It's so good and totally underrated!
1593789004.0,1,Sorry forgot to include my review in comments!
1593798874.0,11,From alldaychemist.com they ship worldwide
1593796830.0,3,You can use curology in the US. I just get it from my primary physician and my insurance covers it. If you’ve got a doctor available it’s worth it to ask because curology is pretty expensive
1593798918.0,1,They are all stellar. That Sukin cream OMG the dream. The Scinic eye cream is gorgeous but does have a little fragrance in it!
1593802328.0,1,It is SO good. I just bought five more jars from iHerb haha I'm so extra.
1593805116.0,1,"I bulk buy them on Yesstyle but I believe they ship almost worldwide. UK has free shipping for all orders over £60. You can also get them on eBay, sometimes for cheaper but sometimes for more so I always double check before I place my next order. Welcome to the UK :)"
1593849386.0,1,I have very dry skin and this feels very hydrating and so pleasant to apply. Nothing harsh in it and no fragrance but smells lovely too.
1593849233.0,1,No I buy it in bulk on alldaychemist.com
1593849264.0,1,"Yes I thought ""why not"" and liking the results!"
1593799267.0,2,Yeah I tend to only use it once and week thinking my skin would get used to it. Never did :(
1593799286.0,2,Probably lol. You live and you learn in this example hahhaag
1593839359.0,2,Now im going to buy it! Thanks OP
1593798893.0,1,Thank you :)
1593797032.0,4,Yes I’ve been using Curology for past 3 years and my skin has gone from night to day . Now that they allow you to manage your shipment date I’ll usually order big bottle every 3 months. Trying to be a little stingy here but this shipment rate works for me. I don’t have a doctor for skin and was wondering If this cream was available over the counter in US. Thanks :)
1593805750.0,1,I’m curious how you get it from your physician as it’s a private company with their own doctors. I have never seen language on their site about that option unless it was just recently added. Curology isn’t an option for everyone unfortunately ... Something in the base cream disagrees with my skin ☹️ but it works well for my daughter.  🙂 I’m curious about the gel option though so I’ll have to put that on the list of questions for my annual physical!
1593799634.0,2,Whyyyyy do they do that? My eyeballs do not need to be perfumed. No-one is going to sniff them.
1593807657.0,1,Thanks so much! The yesstyle shipping fees to Canada end up being so much more than the cost of the sunscreen and all I want to do is try Purito! Canmake is my go to right not but looking to add more for different days like yourself. Thanks for the help!
1593902324.0,1,Thank you.  This helps
1593797634.0,2,You cannot get tret without a prescription in the United States
1593806535.0,3,I don’t use curology anymore. I see my doctor who gave me a prescription for tret that I pick up from the pharmacy for $5. It’s a better option for me cost wise though obviously insurance coverages vary so it may not be as affordable for everyone
1593802295.0,1,"Ugh I know, but I was surprised it even had perfume in it cause I can't smell anything!"
1593849318.0,1,Do you not have a minimum order to buy for free shipping? I just buy extra essences and emulsions to get to £60 as I know I will use all of these anyway.
1593797728.0,4,Ahhh.. my Curology prescription has 0.009% tret  with 1% azelic acid and 9% clindamycin and that formula keeps my skin clear. I’ll stick to Curology for now. Thanks :)
1593807610.0,1,Ahhhh that makes sense - how it was worded made me think you were getting *curology* from your doctor but you’re getting just tret - got it!
1593863773.0,1,"They just announced free shipping on orders of $185, someone in another sub confirmed it was because of covid. Looks like I'm going with ebay!"
1593871819.0,1,Blimey. Hopefully it gets better after Covid. Used to be minimum £30 for UK before the virus.

1593826939.0,53,"I've used both, but I sincerely believe that there isn't a lot of meaningful difference between a toner/serum/essence/ampoule. Technically the labels can indicate things like texture, viscosity, or concentration of ingredients, but it's all really wishy-washy as there are no labelling rules and there is a lot of crossover between products in these ""categories"". I don't really pay attention to the product name and focus instead on the ingredients and what I want those ingredients to do.   

So, for example, if I want to incorporate niacinamide into my routine, I look for products that have 4-5% niacinamide and then look at things like price per mL, texture, other ingredients instead of focusing on whether or not I am looking for a toner or essence."
1593826822.0,17,"The names are super arbitrary. If I want some panthenol in my routine it makes no difference if that panthenol is coming from a toner or an essence. I don't care about the arbitrary marketing terms. I only look at ingredients. Both toners and essences are watery layers that can deliver some beneficial ingredients into the skin. The ingredients I look for in a toner/essence: Amino Acids, Licorice Root, Centella Asiatica, Green Tea and Aloe Vera.

Essences are marketed as being more concentrated than toners, (and serums are marketed as being more concentrated than both) but I haven't found that to be the case at all.

For example, the 2sol Cica Youth Toner contains 10% panthenol. I haven't found a single serum, let alone an essence, that contains that much panthenol. Even the Cos de Baha Panthenol serum (a panthenol centric serum) contains only 4% panthenol.

Another example, the Cos de Baha Niacinamide Toner contains 5% Niacinamide, whereas the CosRx Galactomyces Essence contains only 2%.

So in summary, names don't matter. Ingredients and concentrations thereof are the only things that matter.

I also take issue with the identification of essences as being more viscous than toners, which is sometimes how they are differentiated. I've used toners that are more viscous than essences and I've used essences that are more watery than toners.

All that being said, my favorite essences are Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence, Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence and Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose Edition.

My favorite toners are 2sol Cica Youth Toner, Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, Benton Deep Green Tea Toner and Isntree Aloe Soothing Toner."
1593823428.0,6,"I like using the SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner from Etude House (sometimes more than 1 layer of it patted on the face) and the fermented mugwort essence from Missha when my skin needs some extra hidration. But I don't really use them together.

I also have one of the hyped toners from Biologique Recherche - it was recomended to me by a esthetician that works exclusively with this brand, but I've never used is often enough to check if it really forks for me.

&#x200B;

Also, Leah Yoo on skincare stuff we don't really need:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8) She explains what toners and essences are"
1593822014.0,9,"I have and use both.

My skin type was combo oily, but it's basically normal now (slightly acne prone).

My skin adores the extra hydration. I usually layer on 3 - 4 watery toners/essences with varying ingredients and purposes. But for me, skincare is more about relaxing and enjoying my time than just another necessary step in hygiene, like brushing my teeth or something. 

Current HG is the Utena Magiabotanica Hatomugi Skin Conditioner. I spritz this on multiple times throughout my routine just because. Very lightweight, hydrating, and mildly soothing. 

Other favorites: 

- Siorus Time Is Running Out Mist, I love this one almost as much as the Magiabotanica. I will often use it with just sunscreen afterwards on very lazy mornings. 

- Primera Miracle Seed Essence, new favorite. My skin was already in good shape and this product managed to make it better.

- I'm From Rice Toner, I've been a bit neglectful with it lately, which still means using it nearly every night but only some mornings. Amazing texture and a lovely brightening effect."
1593823787.0,3,"I’ve been using only an essence + serum + moisturizer since the start of quarantine and my skin has actually been really happy. I usually use 2 layers of essence when I have more time (let it soak in more). I’m finishing up the May coop one and then I’m going to go back to the innisfree soybean energy essence, which I already finished off a bottle of.

I have combo skin and used to use both (plus other steps) and I think my skin just does better with less steps."
1593844014.0,3,"I use both. I have dry dehydrated skin so I like using as much as I can. If I had to pick one, I'd choose essence. I really love the Cosrx Snail Mucin essence. It makes my skin hydrated and plump. I currently use the I'm From Rice Toner and it's moisturizing and also sinks into my skin. I want to test the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner next and see how it compares to the I'm From one which I love."
1593860724.0,2,Depends on what you use afterwards. If you are going to use serum or moisturizer afterwards then toner will do. If not then it's better to use essence. Essence is more concentrated version of toner.
1593853657.0,1,"I have and use both. I have combination oily skin with breakouts on my red days which usually leave dark spots.

My favorite hydrating toners are the unscented klairs supple prep toner and the aromatica hyaluronic acid toner. I use 3 layers of my toner and apply each layer after the first layer is absorbed. I find that this method makes my skin smoother and plumper in the morning.
For essences my favorite is the Nacific Niacin essence, I like using niacinamide in my routine but I don’t like the tacky feeling I get from niacinamide serums and this one really faded my dark spots fast.

I think that using both won’t hurt but you have to find essences that work for your skin and your needs because some essences have the same ingredients with some toners. ❤️"
1593868928.0,1,Both but I treat my toner as fancy water.
1593828873.0,8,"Yeah I agree. It doesn’t make any sense to ask “toner or essence” because different toners/essences have different properties, and hence everyone has a difference idea of toners/essences. There’s no standard so it’d be more helpful to reference what properties you’re looking at instead, e.g. watery, more viscous, ingredient concentration."
1593843635.0,3,Just curious what results you get with the 2sol toner? And is it sticky with that much panthenol in it?
1593847276.0,2,"2nd this. Ive jumped on the hype trend of 1st essences, toners, essences and after stacking them one after another in a routine, honestly its just a hydration layer that you need. If your skin is saying you dont need so many layers then you dont, simple as that. (Which is what my skin told me) So now I'm left with 4 toners and 3 essences that I'm trying to finish using one at a time, struggle is real 😂"
1593865696.0,1,I have the Benton deep green tea toner right now and I'm really enjoying it. Only thing I hesitated with when getting this was lack of preservatives but caved in the end because it did sound like an anti-inflammatory dream! The Isntree Aloe soothing toner is on my list to try too.
1593877720.0,1,"Do you think the keep cool and soothe bamboo toner would be suitable for a dry/air conditioned environment? Tried to get my hands on the 2sol toner but because of covid, it's near impossible :("
1593891188.0,3,"It's not sticky at all surprisingly! Mostly robust hydration, meaning, long lasting ""deep"" hydration (unlike Hyaluronic Acid, for example, which doesn't impart long lasting hydration for me at all.) Also plumping and moisture barrier maintenance. But my favorite thing is that it's super hydrating while being basically weightless on the skin.."
1593874627.0,1,"Are you me??!!  :) :) I have all sorts of stuff to finish before I am allowing myself to restock/try stuff (wallet cries silently in the corner) and when I layer them one by one, my skin looks a baby which is full but is still being fed boiled carrots and is about to throw an angry fit!!"
1593866011.0,3,Ya I really really wish Benton formulated with preservatives. But there's something about that toner though! I couldn't stop reaching for it..and it's so affordable.
1593866687.0,3,"Isntree Aloe is more hydrating I think 🙂 just so you know. Actually Isntree Aloe is just as hydrating as Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, which I thought was the most hydrating waterweight toner until now. I LOVE it."
1593888501.0,1,"Yes. The Keep Cool is very hydrating, but depending on your skin you might need to layer.

Are you sure you can't get 2sol?

(It was $22 when I purchased.)

You can also get it here with free worldwide shipping.

1593869792.0,1,"Okay that actually sounds really good, thanks for the feedback, don't really see anyone else talking about it 🙂 yeah the Benton isn't that hydrating but it's okay for the summer months, feels kind of refreshing so I don't mind it for now."
1593890633.0,1,"A different ebay seller I was in contact with stated it would be extra shipping cost and they didn't know how long it would get here. I'll have to check out the 2 sites you linked. Out of keep cool and 2sol, which do you think is better for hydrating skin? My skin can be sensitive and prone to redness. I've tried other toners and essences that seem to have only a short time of hydrating my skin and some I think made my skin drier no matter the method I was applying them: Klairs Supple Toner, I'm From Mugwort Essence, Acwell Licorice Toner, and Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence.Thanks so much for your input :)"
1593890805.0,1,"Are you applying moisturizer after essence and toner?

I think the 2sol is more hydrating but the Keep Cool is more soothing. Also I love Keep Cool because it's EXTREMELY versatile. It can be used anywhere in the routine for added hydration."
1593891201.0,1,"Yes I've been applying them right after moisturizer. I've tried light and heavier moisturizers too with no avail. My skin is hydrated after but then within an hour or two, my skin feels tight and flaky. I bought the LRP Lipikar Balm based on your recommendations and my skin is still flaky. I'm trying not to add too many steps to my routine, but I think an essence, toner, or serum will help with the hydration piece since moisturizers aren't really made for that. Appreciate your input!"
