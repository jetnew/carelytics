1593926609.0,3,"What’s the best product to prevent oncoming pimples? 

I’ve had oily, acne-prone skin for ages now and it’s gotten much better. Recently I’ve been getting a couple large, painful cystic acne every once in awhile. [This](https://imgur.com/a/bXD51Un) is one gigantic and painful pimple. There’s also a few more rising in the cheek area. So asking r/AsianBeauty for some help here. Which product do you use to prevent these?"
1593937743.0,2,"Skin type:combo (oily t zone and dry cheeks and chin)
Country: Canada
Skin concern: deep physical scarring on cheeks, fungal acne on forehead

Routine
AM
-wash my face with water
-alpha abrutin +HA (from ordinary)
-vitamin C suspension 23% (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 

PM
-cerave foaming cleanser
-glycolic acid toner (from ordinary)
-alpha abrutin +HA
-niacinamide (from ordinary)
-hemi Squalane oil (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 


I recently bought these ordinary products so this routine is new. I am looking add few more products containing BHA or benzyl peroxide but am not sure which ones. While browsing I came across coarx snail mucin which is suppose to help with scaring, but I am not sure if I should purchase it. I am also interested in stridex bha 2% acne pads, de la ruz sulfur ointment treatment and paul’s choice bha 2% exolinat. Again I am not sure which one to incorporate. Please give me suggestions about these products or any other that you have in mind that could help with acne scars or fu gal acne."
1593939243.0,2,"Recently I’ve pared down my routine to just a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, with vit c at night and spf in the morning, but I find my skin feeling tight and dry later on in the day. I would say I have combo/dehydrated skin, and I live on the east coast of the US so right now the climate can be either humid or dry, but pretty hot either way.

AM:

Krave matcha cleanser

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

Purito unscented spf 

PM: 

Krave matcha cleanser

Timeless vit c

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

I’ve been thinking about adding in the hada labo lotion after toner or finding a heavier moisturizer, but I’m scared an actual cream will be too heavy for the summer... any suggestions?"

Hyperpigmentation/scars

I wanted to get the purito defense cleanser and the iunik calming gel. But neither are currently available for me... so any suggestions?"
1593933749.0,1,"Question about lightening acne marks! I tried Shark Sauce and wasn't impressed, should I give it more time (used it twice a day for a little over two weeks)? Or should I switch to something stronger, like Double Shark (does that even make a difference?) I'm not tied to niacinamide either, I've been eyeing vitamin C products too, specifically Melano CC. I just worry about how strong everyone says that is and the possibility of breaking out. Have you used these products? How do you think they compare in their ability to lighten acne marks?"
1593946035.0,1,do you know of any fungal acne safe cleansing oils? I want to use my sunscreen but I don’t have anything to remove it with. Thanks so much !
1593949579.0,1,"Any advice for dark under-eye circles? It seems like no matter how much I sleep, they won’t go away. The best thing I’ve tried so far is a caffeine serum from The Ordinary, but it’s so temporary. I’m hoping for something that has more long-lasting effects. Thanks in advance!"
1593952121.0,1,Hey AB! How often do people extract blackheads? I'm interest to get start into my new products!
1593952242.0,1,"How do you apply mascara properly?  

I bought the heroine make long and curl super waterproof mascara, but honestly no clue if I’m applying it currently. 

Do I curl before or after? Both? I have very straight lashes and they usually seem less curled after I apply the mascara to my curled lashes. 

Any tips?"
1593941946.0,3,"Hi, I'm also in Canada and first of all why are you awake lol its so late!

Anyways, a big tip for your TO products is to switch the application time of your Niacinamide and your Vit C. Idk about you, but the gritty texture of the vitamin c is pretty uncomfortable for the daytime and can affect makeup application, plus the high concentration can cause sensitivity, so it's best used at night. 

If you're looking for benzyl peroxide there's a Canadian-made product called Benzagel which is sold in drugstores/online! Its not AB, but it's cheap and good quality so whatever. 

As for the BHA products, Stridex Pads work pretty well, but you might get irritated at first. However, I'd go for either the Paula's choice or Cosrx bha power liquid or Cosrx bha/aha toner, because I think that the pads in the stridex are such a waste. I see that most of the products in your routine are western skin care brands, and since you are posting in r/AsianBeauty, why not look for some AB products? I know Klairs has a really good Vit C serum, and Cosrx is the best brand to start with, almost all their products are good quality and effective. For treating fungal acne, you should actually use an antifungal shampoo, but you really have to be sure its fungal acne, so I'd say ask a dermatologist."
1593947256.0,1,\^\^It might be good to exchange your toner for an essence! (or simply add an essence to your routine)
1593952094.0,1,2 weeks isn’t enough time. Give it around 3 months. Melano CC isn’t particularly strong compared to 15% L-AA.

1593951115.0,1,"Most probably it's genetic then, or your facial bone structure that is causing the shadow. Unfortunately I doubt any topical can help with that. Make sure you aren't deficient in nutrients too, usually iron deficiency also can cause dark circle - check with your GP for this"
1593952456.0,1,I usually curl it first then use the mascara. I try my best to coat it from the root but make sure to not touch the skin haha. Hope that helps xoxo ♥️
1593942939.0,1,"My sleeping schedule is so messed up I be sleeping in the morning and staying awake at night😂
I am super confused about the order of the products tbh. On the deciem website I was recommended to follow this routine because  apparently you shouldn’t be using glycolic acid and Vitamin C in the same routine. 

I am really interested in purchasing some Cosrx products. Where should I buy them? Is iHerb a good place? 

Thank you so much for the help!"
1593952331.0,1,thanks so much !!
1593943717.0,1,"lmaoo same im basically nocturnal at this point. Anyways I totally overlooked the fact that you have glycolic acid in ur routine, in that case the order you have it rn works too! I actually think you might have too many actives tho, you could maybe do the vitamin c every other day, so that ur able to layer other products without worry about any potential problems. Also, do you use a sunscreen? I dont think i saw it in ur description. 

As for where to buy stuff, iHerb is a pretty good place to get them, if yesstyle shipping prices ever go down then that is a good place too, also sukoshi mart has an online shop now with a pretty good AB selection! Sometimes Amazon and eBay might work too lol.

np and good luck on ur skincare journey :)"
1593945416.0,1,"Yeah I do but I forgot to mention it since i barely go out anymore. 

I heard it is a shady website n imma hella scared to make any purchases from there. People say they had to pay extra taxes or duties after the payment, but many things are on sale right now on there."
1593852537.0,11,"I finally gave in and ordered from yesstyle even though the klairs toner was way overpriced (but cheaper than in my own country) and i was dumb enough to add 1 thing that ships in 21 days. Im already out of the klairs and running out of more stuff so i really don't want to wait. 
Lesson here: always double check the shipping time on yesstyle"

1593898896.0,2,I feel you. 2 weeks ago I placed an order (first time with yesstyle) and didnt realize one product had to wait 7-14 days to ship. Now 15 days later still hasnt shipped and in the product description still says 7-14 days to ship. Im mad at my own stupidity :(

1593895327.0,24,I like the CosRx Centella blemish cream. It seems to really help with getting rid of redness when my pimples start to die down.

1593894399.0,23,"A'pieu madecassoside cica gel. It has no added fragrance or essential oils. I buy it by the 100ml tube! Also, the A'pieu madecassoside Sleeping Mask. Just ordered 2 more of those to make sure I don't run out."
1593893405.0,8,Does anyone know a good toner/essence/serum with centella that’s not skin1004?
1593893914.0,9,"I like the cica creams bc they're super soothing, iope has one, but it's super hard to get now, so I just stick to the klairs midnight blue in the fridge. 

Also the cosrx centella ampoule which is super soothing. Also both the benton deep green tea and isntree green tea toners have cica in them as well and are pretty soothing. 

Side note: Is it me, or is the skin1004 ampoule greasy, I feel like it does nothing?"
1593910615.0,9,I love the Etude House Soonjung Cica Balm. It soothes my acne bumps and heals them really fast after I “accidentally” pops them.
1593896199.0,5,i know cica cream isn't \*exactly\* the same thing but has anyone here tried the dr. jart cicapair? i've seen so many people raving about it and i think my next purchase is going to be either purito or this one
1593902261.0,7,"Has anyone tried Sioris' A Calming Day Ampoule? Looking to try it once I've gone through my last bottle of A'Pieu madecassoside ampoule, but the only drawback is it's almost double the price and haven't heard many reviews on it."

1593923642.0,3,Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner... it also has licorice root and aloe in it as well. Dries down without being sticky.
1593929078.0,3,"Dr. Belmeur Advanced Cica Recovery Cream is great! It's pretty lightweight but does good things for my dry skin especially using it on top of a facial oil (I use squalane)

Sidenote... I just have to say it. Purito sucks as a sunblock. Absolutely sucks! I don't know why everyone here loves it. I feel like people just love the texture (it is very moisturizing) and formula but don't realize it's not very effective. It doesn't last at all. I bought some to give it a shot and wore it out today, reapplying the correct amount (two finger-length lines) and patting it in at appropriate intervals. I got sunburned on my face for the first time in *years*! It's not a bad burn, thankfully, but I was stunned at first. I guess I'm not surprised after seeing that UV camera post that showed how poorly it lasts."

1593950838.0,1,"I knoow right ! But after searching more and since I follow some youtubers who avoid fragrance I found many products without it. If you're looking for a type of product don't hesitate to ask.


For sunscreen I still haven't found my HG but I'm planning to try bioderma ar tinted spf 50. Bioderma is an amazing brand for sensitive skin I aleeady use two of their products. The purito centella unscented spf 50 also has a lot of great reviews."
1593951056.0,1,"Purito UV scented is chemical sunscreen which is why I am still hesitating to get that. I am considering purito comfy block. Ah yes, bioderma is what I am looking at too.

Out of curiosity, do you follow Kelly Driscoll and Dr Dray? I follow them and they have helped a lot!"
1593951601.0,1,"Yes that's why I'm still hesitating too, bioderma is also a chemical sunscreen but the UVA protection is better than purito sunscreens that's why I wanted to try it this summer. And it's also a product that is supposed to be for sensitive skin and anti redness. But I don't know I will try it and let you know if I like it.


Yees hahah that's the youtubers I was talking about 😄 It's dr dray who recommended  bioderma photoderm ar spf in one of her videos."
1593952438.0,1,Yup. I saw that video today 😂 Bioderma is chemical! Oh no! I am still to check out it's ingredients. Please let me know how you like it.

1593858446.0,97,"Recently I decided to incorporate Aquaphor into my routine to help with Tretinoin dryness, because everyone seems to like it (lol). Itching like I have never had before. I thought it was just the usual tret irritation, so kept it up a few more nights until it got to the point I wanted to claw my face off. I thought maybe it was the Lanolin in it, so switched to Vaseline and cut out the tret, thinking the tret was sensitizing my face to the Lanolin. I immediately had the same reaction, except five times worse. I had to wash it all off multiple times within a few hours, it was that unbearable. I cut out all skincare for a few days and am just getting back to applying a bare minimum routine of moisturizer + SPF / tret. I have such sensitive skin, I wish I could be more surprised that I apparently react to petroleum jelly of all things."
1593862232.0,88,"After trying out several AB samples I'd received following some time in the exchange sub, I finally placed one large order for all of the products that were successful samples for me. Then when they all arrived, I started using them all at once. And my skin freaked out. Even though I knew all the products worked for me, starting them all at once was a huge mistake. I stopped using all of them and went back to my original routine then started adding in one new product at a time for at least a week or two before adding the next product into the routine. Please don't be like me. Remember to only add one new product at a time until you know it's ok."
1593855033.0,45,"Cleansing oils (I tried Shu Uemura & Hada Labo) unfortunately broke me out and I continued using for half a year without realizing, switched to Hada Labo to try again but still the same results.

Also accidentally irritated my skin when I had a pimple and applied multiple products (including The Body Shop tea tree oil & 10% benzoyl peroxide) to try to curb it. It still hasn’t fully recovered and I can’t apply even just tea tree oil without irritating it."
1593857039.0,34,"The first time I got into AB I went to some well-reviewed AB-oriented shop and somehow got convinced to spend $200ish on an alcohol-based toner, a meh cleanser, and a moisturizer that all lasted me a month or so.

Nowadays my routine is like 40-50 bucks for 6 months lol."
1593875466.0,17,"I went on a shopping spree and bought a bunch of Paula's Choice serums, and a new hair conditioner (can you guess where this is going?). A few days later I had a full body rash and I started panic removing products from my routine. I was so upset that all these lovely serums would go to waste and I was back to square one... cut to now, a few weeks later, I've tested each serum and found out it was actually the damn hair product. Lesson learned, test all your products!!"
1593849816.0,31,"I’m the type to never really get irritated by any skincare even with fragrance, EOs, etc. and I **used** to just buy anything and everything. Basically my skin isn’t very sensitive. 

Which makes my skincare fails even more INTENSE (for me) because I was so shocked that my skin actually got irritated lol. The first was the SNP animal panda whitening mask. It felt like it was burning but I thought it was part of the ~process~ (yes, my mistake) and after taking it off my face was so red and stingy. I looked tan for like 3 weeks after! 

The Cosrx hydrogel very simple packs irritated my cheeks too but not my forehead for some reason >.<"
1593870226.0,9,"I've gotten used to exfoliating twice a week. I didn't take into consideration that now that I have to wear a mask everyday at work for 8 hours, my face is much more sensitive and irritated (even though it is a soft cotton mask). On top of that, since it is summer my skin is even more sensitive from going to 3 months quarantine with barely any sun exposure to seeing lots of sun everyday. 

But I kept up exfoliating twice a week a long with a million step routine and it made my skin so red, angry and painful. I've finally wisened up and only exfoliate once during the weekend and shorten my routine steps during the week. My face has healed up nicely, although it is still a feat to get through the mask wearing week without pissing my skin off too much."
1593866872.0,10,"Cosrx snail mucin. It worked for me for a whole bottle. Then i buy my 2nd one and it made my skin itchy, red, bumps. I didnt realize that after i use almost half of it."
1593851091.0,16,"Cosrx rice overnight spa mask caused weird bumps between my eyebrows and red spots on my cheeks.

Cosrx holy moly snail mask made my skin dull.

(I still love cosrx as a brand tho)

Round Lab Dokdo cream broke me out horribly.

Missha total ceramide cream gave me closed comedones.

Skin and Lab barrierderm relief balm also caused breakouts ony dry skin.

( I think shea butter and silicone combined don't agree with my skin)

Isntree green tea lotion was too too drying for my dry dehydrated skin.

Purito centella buffet serum and centella suncreen made me realize that bergamot oil irritates my skin and lavender oil irritates my eyes. Good thing they came out with Unscented versions without those essential oils which are now my HG!"
1593861834.0,5,"The Innisfree green tea seed serum was the worst one for me. Horrible rash and swelling that only subsided with hydrocortisone. Still don't know what caused that reaction.

Another one is the Benton cacao cream. Cacao seed butter (comdogenic = 4) in it broke me out really bad and left PIE for like a year."
1593862053.0,7,TO Niacinimide broke my skin out and started horrible breakouts for me even after I stopped using it for a while.

Apieu madecassoside ampoule/skin1004 ampoule- both the skin1004 first because i wanted to add centella to my routine since its supposed to be very safe, i broke out in comedones and tiny clogs like cosrx. Ithough maybe it was something else so i tried the apieu one too and the same thing happened. Guess my skin doesnt like centella. big sad."
1593859056.0,4,I tried sidmool's niacinamide serum and the ordinary's 10% niacinamide and i find both did.. nothing? I see lots of people with good results from incorporating a good dose of niacinamide in their routine but i didn't see much difference. I also felt like some water-like toners (like roundlab dokdo toner) does absolutely nothing. Cosrx AHA burns my skin barrier away when i'm only using it once a week. Also not exactly a skincare fail but i find makeup goes on blotchy on top of matte sunscreens.
1593861864.0,3,I used benzoyl peroxide 5% I think on my face as a 20yo and then woke up in the morning and lightly wet my face with water the next day. Within 18 hours my skin was full blown chemically burnt and was for over a week.
1593866133.0,5,"Every single product I tried from Purito...

I bought the Snail Mucin Essence, then 1 month later Aloe+BHA toner, then 6 month later the Buffet serum. Every single time my skin immediately turns greasy as hell and small white pimple appear all over my face.   
As soon as I stop using the product, everything goes back to normal.It's really a shame because I love the ethics of this brand, but apparently their products are not for me !

And Granactive retinoids from TO : it immediately lits my face on fire."
1593882161.0,4,"Thinking differin and benzoyl peroxide was the miracle cure for moderate to severe acne, I started caking on benzoyl and differin every day and probably gave myself way worse cystic acne and scars on my left side that was usually pretty clear."
1593884427.0,4,"My skin has been absolutely *terrible* the past few months. I'm not sure what caused everything, but knowing that my skin is already dry, sensitive, and acne-prone while having problems with eczema since I was like 10 or 11 (am 23 now) made me realize that some of the new things I recently tried were pretty dumbass things to do lol.

When quarantine started, I decided it would be a good time to try to use up all of the skincare I had bought and either didn't really like that much or couldn't find a place in my routine to use them due to finding other products that I loved and shared the same purpose. Of course, a lot of those products had fragrance in them, and there were a ton of sheet masks I wanted to use up as fast as possible. *Well, imagine my shock* when my face started getting drier with more acne. Shortly after, I also started getting tiny bumps all over my skin (I still don't know if that's fungal acne or a ton of CCs since it kind of looks like FA but doesn't itch at all, which is why I have a derm appointment at the end of this month). 

I stopped that plan and decided to just use what worked for me while adding in some exfoliating products. I only exfoliated once or twice a week, so I thought maybe I should do more? I only had the Krave Kale-la-lu-yaha glycolic acid and didn't want to use too much of that, so I got the CeraVe SA Renewing cleanser to use every other day. I figured it would be a gentler but more consistent way of exfoliating since I would be washing it off after a shorter time of contact with my skin. I also used the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating cleanser any time I didn't use the SA cleanser (FYI, I only cleanse at night and use a rosewater toner to wipe off any residue in the morning). 

Of course, I then came across the 60-second cleansing method that's supposedly good for any skin type and supposedly saved tons of people's skin. I started using that method when I regularly cleansed at night, but then I saw some people saying you need to do it with all of your cleansing products every morning and night and oil cleanser should be used even if you just wear sunscreen instead of makeup during the day. Three days after double-cleansing at night and cleansing in the morning one time (still switching between the Krave and CeraVe cleansers every other day and using the iUNIK Calendula Complete cleansing oil as my first cleanse at night), I had bumps, dryness, and inflammation all over my face. I had completely destroyed my skin barrier.

I immediately stopped everything I was doing and just used one moisturizer (Benton Deep Green Tea lotion), one sunscreen, (Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF45 PA+++), and one cleanser (Krave). My skin was a lot better after the first week or so, but it was still dry, so I started using the Benton Cacao Moist and Mild cream at night. 

Now that it's been a little over a month, my skin has mostly gone back to normal. I still have some pustules, the maybe/maybe not FA, and some dryness (which is mostly because I've been crying for like a week since we found out one of our cats is in liver failure and we have to put her down in two days 🙃 2020 is the worst year), but my skin overall seems to be in better condition. Last week, I started using TO Niacinamide again to see if it would help the maybe/maybe not FA and to just finish it off because I actually hate the texture of it and feel like it makes my face 10x drier. The bumps on my forehead have reduced a little, so I'm going to finish off products I'm using right now and use the two products I have that are FA safe: Hada Labo Gokujyun Moist lotion and Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing gel (still gonna use the Krave cleanser, and I just bought like three bottles of the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented sunscreen before finding out it wasn't FA safe, so I'm still gonna use those). I'd buy more FA safe products and treatments now, but I'm still not sure that I actually have FA and am kinda afraid to try anything too intense because of my chronic eczema.

On the bright side, I've almost completely eliminated fragrance from my routine."
1593888589.0,3,The COSRX snail essence that I once bought because I wanted to nourish my skin but really just clogged my skin and broke me out like mad 😭

1593861392.0,3,I don't have sensitive skin and considered myself one of the lucky ones who can put any type of product on their face and it works. So imagine my utter horror when Neutrogena hydroboost caused a massive itchy acne breakout on my face which disappeared the day after I stopped using it. It was crazy and I was completely disappointed. Now I stick to aloe vera :/
1593879785.0,3,"Niacinamide sensitivity? - read so much positive feedback about this ingredient, had really high expectation. 

Tried a couple of times to incorporate it into my routine. First with TO 10% + zinc, then again with a K-beauty toner Rovectin and Olay regenerist which both has niacinamide listed pretty high on the ingredient list. I didn’t use them all at once, only a couple of drops and tried them all separately with no layering involved so basically my routine was just salicylic acid wash, any of the above followed by a light moisturiser. 

Every single time I get tiny white bumps all over my forehead, cheeks, everywhere the day after."
1593884229.0,3,Not AB but i used the Ordinary’s niacinamide and zinc serum for like three months before realizing it was breaking me out 😭 i was so disappointed since I only ever hear people talking about how it helped them so much lol.
1593899627.0,3,"My most glorious fail was using the Cosrx Snail Essence and Mizon snail BB cream. 

I bought them because I heard sooo many rave reviews online, I have always had issues with dry skin so thought they'd work well. Initially bought the BB cream and loved it, however after a while I started experiencing breakouts. Didn't really think much of it. Some time later I bought the Cosrx essence, and that is when (for a lack of a better term) sh*t hit the fan. The essence worsened my breakouts to the point where I was experiencing borderline cystic acne and I stupidly used the products in conjunction for a long time. At some point I must have put two and two together and stopped using them and lo and behold, my skin cleared up. At some point I tried to use the essence again and immediately after first use I broke out so needless to say I yeeted that thing straight in the bin. Haven't used snail products since (about two years now) and I have never had anything like this happen again.

One thing I since realised in hindsight- when I first bought the Mizon BB cream, my mum told me she tried using a snail cream in the past but she was allergic and had to stop using it. I stupidly thought it wouldn't apply to me so went ahead with using the products mentioned. What a mistake!!

Sorry for the long comment but yeah ... Just because a product is popular and works wonders for a majority of the people, doesn't mean it will work for you..! I leaned that the hard way lol"
1593905366.0,3,I tried going to a facialist for peels for an entire year only to discover that what my skin likes best is being entirely left alone except for a $4 Korean madecassoside cream and a retinol. I spent $170 a peel once a month for a year to discover that my skin looks a hell of a lot better if I keep most acids away from it.
1593876703.0,3,"My skincare boo-boo was when I used extra virgin olive oil on my face as my makeup remover. I had large, painful pimples as a result. Everyday, there was a new pimple forming. I couldn't even look in the mirror because of how ugly I felt that time. My mother then accompanied me to a derma and my skin problem was solved. I will never ever use extra virgin olive oil on my face again!"

I used it for a little while two separate times, and each time after a couple consistent days of usage my small red dots appear on my face. When I stopped using it a couple days later the dots disappeared. I wasn’t sure if it was because of the serum or my terrible sleep schedule at the time, so I tried using it again and the same thing happened. Quite disappointed. Never again."
1593868749.0,2,"never ever try Madeca Derma Cream, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you're a beginner in skincare. I saw it from a Filipina vlogger she was so confident that the product is like a magical cream, she even invited people to testify the product's effectivity in her channel to prove that it really works🙄, she also recommended to just keep using it even if you're breaking out from it saying that its normal because you'll experience purging. I paired madeca with cetaphil cleanser, garnier micellar water(pink) and belo whitening sunscreen, it's impossible that the breakout was from these products because i was using it way before i tried madeca. Overall madeca only worsened my skin condition, i thought the micro-peeling effect was a good sign, i didnt know that its already damaging my skin barrier,  i was a beginner in skincare so i was so naive and got swayed easily lol, i didnt even read the ingredients list because i trusted it so much, denatured alcohol was the top ingredient of madeca and it also consist of shea butter, and a bunch of different essential oils, basically it has all the worst ingredients that you can think of lol. I used to idolize that filipina vlogger bc her skincare reviews and makeup tutorials are always on point and she seems very credible lol, but lesson learned never trust anyone but experts(Hyram is counted lol)."
1593873256.0,2,Using cyspera in the morning then washing it off and adding acids after that. I got a headache and puked tons after that. Now the stench from cyspera reminds me of puke. It really stinks. I really discourage anyone from using it on your face. The smell is soooo hard to wash off. Probably better for pigmentation on other areas of your body.
1593875315.0,2,"Months ago i tried the Purito centella buffet serum. I had high hopes and my skin looked fantastic for a couple of days, then i started breaking out in tiny blisters that turned into pimples that wouldn't heal. Apparently that high a concentration of centella asiatica sensitized me to that ingredient and now i can't use anything with centella without breaking out in little allergic blister pimples. Had to stop using several products i really liked because my skin suddenly won't tolerate them."
1593876661.0,2,"When I was reading this I was wondering if I wrote this, lol. Same here. I purchased this two the ordinary products and they gave me allergic reaction with red bumps and such an uncomfortable irritation. I didn’t use anything else new in my routine apart from them. And rest of the products in my routine, are working for me for quite sometime now. These products are so popular, Im sure they are working fine for many but Im glad to know Im not alone."
1593880714.0,2,"The Cosrx snail mucin was my first AB product ever. I was so excited to try it because it had such amazing reviews. One week later I had broken out with the WORST cystic acne since I was a teenager. Then I went down the rabbit hole of using harsh products like the Dr. Dennis Gross peeling pads and clay masks. I ended up going on meds. It’s been a couple of years but I still flinch when I see people talk about snail products. The Cosrx sent me down a very misguided path and I learned about skincare the hard way. I wish I had known that YMMV and to start slow! (Also, I read that there may be a correlation between dust mite allergy and sensitivity to snail products?? Whaaaaat.)"

1593884056.0,2,"It was around five years ago during my first year of living the AB lifestyle. I had heard so many good things about vitamin C so I decided to incorporate it into my routine, which was still mostly in trial mode as I was working on finding the most efficient products for my skin. So I ordered the C20 vitamin C serum and started using it, if I remember correctly I didn't rush it, took it slow. 

My skin seemed to be okay with it at first, but not long after I started to get huge angry pimples on my cheeks and chin. No idea why I didn't immediately suspect the latest new product, I guess I really wanted to believe in it. At some point I had a disgusting trio of the ugliest biggest pimples on my right cheek a centimeter from my nose. You can imagine how horrified I was, but no matter what I did, they wouldn't go away. I had never before had any sort of breakout on my cheeks before that, even during my teens only my T-zone was ever affected. 

I fought hard, even got several very specific products to fight them, such as Cosrx Asol, lots of blemish patches and ointments, but they kept on coming and always appeared in the same area. At some point I gave up and accepted my fate, but then I suddenly ran out of my vit C serum and luckily hadn't ordered a new one yet. Lo and behold, after going without for an amount of time my skin cleared up and ever since that time I haven't had any breakouts on my cheeks. At that point I finally made the connection between vitamin C serum and the breakouts so I have steered clear of vitamin C since then."
1593895331.0,2,"Last night I applied a pea sized blob of the Uruoi Deep Moisture Gel that I just purchased and it felt great. Until I went to bed that is, it stayed fairly tacky/sticky and I had applied it down my neck too, so I kept sticking to my pillow. Perhaps it is a daytime only moisturizer for me now.

My long-term, never again, not in a million years fail is the CosRX Galactomyces Essence. Triggered a seborrheic dermatitis flare with rashes on my face that would migrate in patches (left cheek to right cheek, forehead, down the sides of my face, etc) and I didn't know what was going on for several months, and it was hot, red, and scaly. It's caused by the same yeast as fungal acne, so I had to adopt an FA-safe routine and it finally cleared up. Took about a year to resolve actually and I was very afraid of oils in any skincare item for a long time. It's been about 4 years now and I'm only now cautiously trying a few oils in my routine again. The Uruoi product mentioned above is one of them. No fermented ingredients (namely galactomyces) for me!"

1593919833.0,2,"Definitely over-exfoliating my face and not even knowing it was a thing! 

Started off (3 years ago!) with bumps on my forehead before I went on holiday to Jordan which is extremely hot. While I was there, I wanted to try and get an acne cream so I bought the first thing I saw which was tret as I didn't have much knowledge into how strong these acne treatments were and it was easily bought otc. I cringe everytime I think of this but I would use this EVERYDAY without spf and go into the hot sun to tan. This started making things noticeably worse. In hindsight, I think it was fungal acne fed by the heat and products I was using however I didn't even know that was a thing at the time.

I didn't even realise the damage I'd done and the over-exfoliation led to a constant cycle of more spots on my forehead which I tried to tackle with even more harsh products. My routine  then consisted of a salicylic acid cleanser with one of those even harsher spin brushes, glycolic acid pads straight after, and then benzoyl peroxide! I want to cry everytime I remember this routine. Sometimes I'd even add in a cheeky st ives or overnight glycolic acid mask. My face kept deteriorating, it was always red and it actually looked like leather at one point. It was shiny, but so dry to the touch I felt like I could see my reflection in it and at the time there wasn't much on over-exfoliation so I didn't even realise what the problem was. 

Needless to say I was fighting a losing battle with my skin for the last 3 years because even after I found out my moisture barrier was absolutely destroyed, it was impossible to find products that would heal it without clogging pores and feeding fungal acne. It was a nightmare. But yeah, think it's finally on the mend lol"

I blame the fragrance, but honestly I don't know why it happened. But it encouraged me to switch to AB products, so all's well that ends well, I guess. 

More recently, my Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel waterproof sunscreen seems to have caused some huge, irritated red bumps on my temple, along with other scattered pimples. I really like this stuff, so I'm going to give it another go and hope it's just a matter of cleansing more thoroughly since it's waterproof.

Their Green Tea Fresh Toner is great and I really love it; can't get enough of it. I substituted the Benton Deep Green Tea Lotion for the Isntree one and it's a great lightweight moisturizer for oily skin.

Last summer I bought the Neogen Real Ferment Micro Serum and was so excited and had high expectations, but I didn’t patch test and it made me break out. A few weeks later I patch tested it and yep, breakout confirmed. Thankfully I was able to return it. 

A couple summers ago I finally started using the Hada Labo Premium Gokujyun lotion and while I can’t 100% scientifically prove it was that, ha, my lips got SO dry and dehydrated, to the point where it hurt to smile. They started to get better when I stopped the Gokujyun and now I just use it as a mix in for my body lotion."

I wasn’t using it daily because I sometimes never left the house during the day due to the nature of my job (I know, I know).

Now that I’m wearing the Timeless and Shiseido together consistently, I broke out all along the lower half of my face. I haven’t broken out in probably over a year now so I was kind of bummed. The part that made me laugh the most was editing my recent YouTube video (where I talk about skincare) and hearing myself say “as you can see, my skin has been doing really good lately” in reference to my consistent routine for over a year now. I have no idea what is breaking me out since I used both separately without much of an issue and all of a sudden I have a mountain range on my face. Sucks, but hopefully it goes away soon."

One of the tips there was to remove mineral makeup using extra virgin olive oil. I thought that was a hard rule when it comes to mineral makeup usage. :P"
1593918260.0,1,Oh yes I’ve used elta MD and using purito mineral sunscreens and they haven’t broken me out!! But they both have some level of pilling. Do any of those not pill?
1593898162.0,2,"There’s a lot of overlap in many of the items! But I do notice some differences in some of the hype products. 

In Korea the Round Lab Dokdo line has been pretty raved about, especially the toner. But I think people here enjoy this as well. Round Lab’s Birch Juice line is also gaining some traction, especially their moisturizing cream and UV sun cream. Something I don’t see often here from Round Lab is their 365 Derma Relief Sun Cream. It’s a highly rated sunscreen in Korea but rarely do I see it talked about here. 

Also, Be Plain Chamomile Toner and their Cicaful Ampoule is raved about. I see these a bit on here though. One thing I noticed is a lot of calming and soothing ingredients are focused on in Korea. Repairing the skin barrier was huge for a while.

Something I don’t see here as often is The Lab by Blanc Doux. Their Hyaluronic Toner was quite a craze a while ago after Director Pi on Youtube suggested it. It apparently has different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid so it’s more effective at locking in moisture. 

Another big brand in Korea that I rarely see here is Sidmool. A lot of their products are highly rated, especially their moisturizers and hydrating products. Unfortunately I can’t seem to find them anywhere online for international shipping :( 

FYI - I probably missed a lot and this list might be a little outdated! Director Pi on Youtube has had a huge impact on Korean skincare and how people purchase products. She puts english subs on most of her videos too so, maybe try checking her out for more product info!"
1593896136.0,1,I’m worried that my skin has developed a sensitivity to chemical sunscreens because I tried a couple other ones without fragrance and they burned too :(
1593882708.0,2,It is OK to use them together. I mix Niacinamide and vitamin C all the time. In fact Paula's Choice call it a 'winning combination'. With exception of TO because of their own formulation
1593883060.0,3,Do you put on anything under cicaplast ?
1593866689.0,11,I'm the same! I can't use oil cleansers as they irritate my skin like no other. I can only use micellar water and gel or foam cleansers to double cleanse.
1593868834.0,6,Ok thanks. I wear mineral sunscreen and my micellar water just doesn't quite seem to remove it thoroughly. I'm still looking for that magic non clogging cleanser but maybe it's just my skin haha
1593891614.0,1,I'm also the same! Been using micellar water and still on the hunt for that good cleansing oil but haven't had any luck yet. Damn sensitive skin
1593880404.0,1,"I probably read it from articles for rosewater, about how it has almost no side effects compared to other essential oils like teatree oil etc, and when I checked TBS's tea tree oil review for my country, many report breakouts. I am thinking of getting Mario Badescu drying lotion for spot treatment; have you tried it?"
1593861126.0,14,"Let me guess... you also have perfect skin and never break out? There really is something to having a pared down, simple routine. Starting to realise less is probably more when it comes to skincare.

My bf also uses Hada Labo (he took it from me) over a water facial mist along with a Biore sunblock I bought him for daytime. At night he just washes his face with water and he uses my Cosrx gel face wash whenever he feels ""a little oily,"" which is every two weeks or so -_- That's it, and he practically has no visible pores or skin problems to speak of."
1593937039.0,1,please add SPF to your skincare routine....
1593896203.0,2,Is it normal to purge every time with aha/bha? I always get little bumps after aha that go away after a day. I’m not sure what to think of them as they aren’t true pimples.
1593866029.0,4,"it might be 1,3-propanediol. if your skin1004 ""100% centella"" ampoule is 90% 1,3-propanediol, 10% centella extract powder, that would certainly explain why you have issues with it.  a lot of these diols and glycols are well tolerated at low concentrations but not high.

i have it, too, and i would choose a different carrier."
1593937729.0,1,"Hi! Currently I only use TO products for PM routine; so I start immediately with the Niacinamide, and then AA, and then Innisfree's cream spread thinly. :D"
1593922212.0,2,"I didn't buy it to use as a hydrating layer, I'm just using it as a hydrating layer, given that it can't serve any other purpose in my routine (I have other products that I prefer for the other stuff it's supposed to do)"
1593887629.0,1,I see! I’ve also been thinking about trying it (with oil during the night and on its own in daytime cuz I also use sunscreen). My face is oily naturally and it doesn’t get dehydrated easily so I have some hope. Thanks for the reply!
1593932445.0,1,"Interesting. Yeah hyaluronic acid generally works with most skin types altho some particular products can cause reactions. For example, I love the Habo Lado Gokujyun Moisturizing Lotion, but I have read from some people on here that it made them break out. So not sure if it’s the formulation or other ingredients, or 🤷🏻‍♂️

And where do you live? Generally Amazon is an all-around solid choice that can sometimes net you much lower prices than from Asian boutiques or even a product’s actual brand website. But it’s also frustrating because not all AB products are on Amazon."
1593918352.0,2,I haven’t experienced pilling. Could vary by skin type though. I am oily.
1593900112.0,1,"Hmm, that may be the case. When we slather chemical sunscreen on our faces daily, I feel like eventually we'll develop sensitivities. It's a fine line :/ Also, the burning may be happening if your moisture barrier is compromised. Just a thought!"
1593887003.0,1,"Some nights I cleanse, then Clindamycin (topical liquid form), then Cicaplast, then tretinoin. Some nights I flip the order of the tret and Cicaplast.

I haven’t tried Cicaplast in the morning yet, as I’m not sure how it will interact with my Vitamin C serum, sunscreen, and makeup. It might make my face too dewy for daytime? Not sure!"
1593872804.0,11,"Feels rare to find more people with cleansing oil intolerance! Cleansing oils are always touted as THE ultimate double cleansing product, sucks that I can’t reap all the benefits."
1593902325.0,3,"I get irritated from oil and balm cleansers that emulsify and rinse off with water. My skin would always feel tight and dry, but I realised it was happening only after rinsing off. I’ve started just wiping it off with a tissue before going in with a gentle second cleanse to get the remainder off and that seems to solve the issue. It seems a little counterintuitive since the main appeal of these new generation oil cleansers is that they do rinse clean, but boy something in that mechanism dried my skin out so much. In future I might just switch to oil cleansing with a traditional oil and since I’m using my second cleanser to do the emulsify and rinse part anyway."
1593872696.0,1,Perhaps adding a toner step with cotton pad to hydrate + wipe off any residue could help? It’s what I do too but I never find any residue. I use hada labo deep clean & blemish face wash if that helps. Good luck finding the perfect products for you!
1593866644.0,4,I wonder if girls can do less routine too ><
1593872515.0,1,Wow I wasn't aware of both of these things. Thankyou so much!
1593906186.0,1,"i see, then i might consider trying out those powdered centella and just mixing a bit with my toner to check.ty"
1593873794.0,7,"I'm actually surprised too, I've never expected other people to have the same experience as I do with oil cleansers. It's so universally liked and talked about. Yes, I totally get what you mean, I'm always super jealous of people for being able to use oil cleansers, especially when they talk about how easy it is to use, the pore cleaning action (grits), etc."
1593872897.0,8,"Tbh I scaled my routine back a ton after a few years of going berserk with skincare and my skin has been happier for it.

I am lucky that i overall have decent skin. It’s very tolerant of new items and i don’t get significant acne unless there’s a real trigger.

My only real issues are old acne scars from the dark ages, largeish pores, and minor fine lines (I’m in my 30s). So I have maybe 2-3 actives that I use. Vitamin c a few times a week, retinol nightly, and SA when my skin gets rough (maybe a few times a month if that).

I cut out all the rest of the experiments and haven’t had any negative affects by doing so"
1593894055.0,3,You need to do what works for your skin. I spent a decade on variations of very minimal routines. My 8 step routine has been transformative for my skin. If I try to scale back on anything my skin back slides in some way.
1593872656.0,1,"Yes, they definitely can. I'm trying to simplify my current skincare routine because I see people getting great results with far less than I'm using. I think simpler products with less ingredients are key. All the potential chemicals and stuff I'm layering on is starting to concern me as I've had contact and seborrheic dermatitis in the past, likely from compromising my skin's natural barrier."
1593899490.0,1,What type of skin do you have?
1593891178.0,2,Wym by “potential chemicals”? Everything is a chemical
1593911121.0,1,"Sensitive, acne prone, and very dehydrated. Pulling back on layers of hydration results in a lot of oil compensation and closed comedones. It’s a balancing act of trying to keep my skin hydrated and calm while also encouraging the cell turnover needed to keep pores clear."
1593892258.0,2,Chemicals that trigger allergic reactions if it wasn't clear

1593884408.0,50,"Melano cc! There’s a reason it’s an HG for many people on this sub. Tons of reviews on it already but for me, it’s the only vit C product which has visibly improved my skin in a relative short time frame (I’ve tried OST, Klairs, Wishtrend, Glossier, TO). My old PIH have faded noticeably, new acne scars aren’t as red. The packaging is also genius, don’t really have to worry about oxidation I find!"
1593885052.0,9,"Wishtrend! Its the most effective thing for my skin. I wish the melano cc worked for me like others as I like the packaging and how it doesn't oxidize, but it did nothing for me."
1593906892.0,4,"Shark Sauce in the Great White Shark variety! Vitamin C, niacinamide, licorice, and sea kelp!"
1593909442.0,4,"Neogen real vita C powder! I mix it into my toner in the morning. Nice for traveling and you don’t have to worry about it oxidizing. It is grainy unless you let it sit in your liquidy product for a couple of minutes. I have pretty hearty skin for vitamin C though - for sensitive skin, encapsulated vitamin C may be better. (Also Melano CC for sure! )"
1593906450.0,3,I've been using klairs vit drop! So far I've found it helps lighten my belmishes and helps with texture
1593899011.0,2,has anyone tried the Rhoto C serum? i don’t have experience with vitamin c and want to start with something affordable and effective. i’m 27 and am starting to see a tiny bit of sun damage and want something brightening.
1593912023.0,1,"Innisfree Brightening Pore Serum! It helped my acne scars fade away to faintly visible within a month, plus it has hyaluronic acid which helps with hydration."
1593919308.0,1,"I have sensitive skin so I cant handle pure vitamin c . I found this amazing substitute called Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening Serum. It contains a lot of vitamins, not just vitamin c due to the sea buckthorn. Also has niacinamide too :)

 perfect for sensitive skin!"
1593922176.0,1,"Melano CC was kinda meh for me, but  2sol Facial Recovery Booster is delivering. Its also go 10% niacinamide and Panthenol so I'm killing multiple birds with one stone."
1593937210.0,1,"i really want to try out the Melano cc but im still currently using PURITO vitamin C serum. Thoughts of Purito's one is when i first started using it oh damn my acne scars on my face really lighten. It has really helped me slowly but surely improve acne scars and dark spots. One thing that you might not like about the PURITO one is that is has a strong and not very pleasant smell. There is no fragrance in the formulation, so it has a somewhat strange smell, when i started using i was really put off by it, but as time goes im slowly getting used to it."
1593953402.0,1,"Melano CC works great as a spot treatment but I don't like it on my entire face.

Other than that, not into AB Vit C's, as all seem to have EOs. Favorite so far is Nufounatin C20+ Ferulic sold on Amazon. Made fresh."
1593901284.0,-8,AB doesn't make good vitamin c serums. I would recommend formulas with published studies of efficacy such as skinceuticals or timeless
1593910553.0,9,This didn’t work for me. Read quite a number of reviews that this causes breakout so tried avoiding it but saw it on sale 2 months ago in a local store so tried it. Tried on some spots to see what’s the rave about. Gave 3 days gap on each usage to slowly intro to my routine. Only used it twice and my face say no bro. This is the first product for me that causes breakout.
1593886555.0,7,THIS. I love Melano CC
1593892437.0,7,I honestly couldn’t believe how well it works compared to the many other (even more expensive!) brands I’ve tried.
1593907051.0,5,"I just started using it two weeks ago and the glow is real.

I used to use TO 20% but I hated the texture so much I rarely used it. So maybe I will finally see some results with actual consistent use. I like the Yusuf scent too and the oily texture lets it sink it quickly after washing my face."
1593909262.0,3,Hi! I’m wondering which product you use? I’m just hearing about this and when I look it up it seems like there’s a lotion and essence
1593935306.0,1,"100% this! I love melano cc, helps reduce scarring marks from acne. Also  im based in singapore and the type that is available in stores here has alcohol in it, which is not effective for me at all! So make sure to check the ingredients before purchasing."
1593887347.0,4,It dint work for me .. dint see any improvement at all after 6 months too.. now changed to timeless vitamin c 2 weeks back. Seems to be good so far but would be good to wait for few more
1593895794.0,3,Good point! Products work differently for different people! ☺️
1593903984.0,1,Do you use the 21.5% or the 15%+ Ferulic Acid+Niacinamide one?
1593909814.0,2,Make sure you don't take so long to finish the bottle because it oxidizes so easily in our climate. I wasted half a bottle. Huhu. I think buying the smaller size is wiser?
1593911120.0,1,I feel you on that... you want it to work for you as well as it did for others but your skin just says nope 😢 But you won’t know how it works for you until you try!
1593910962.0,8,It’s the essence that most talk about! Look for the thin silver tube!
1593911224.0,2,"I was the exact opposite! Tried Timeless 20% for over 6 months without results, but saw noticeable improvements with Melano CC in a number of weeks. Heads up that the Timeless is STRONG, and it may take some time to work up to daily use."
1593904031.0,2,The 21.5%.
1593944502.0,1,"I’ve had mine for over a year and it still hasn’t oxidised!! I keep the bottle inside the original box in the fridge. 

A lot of people don’t keep it in the box but I think that’s important because I read that the light from the fridge can cause it to oxidise quicker"
1593911224.0,1,I've only started using it for two months I think? So haven't seen anything strange. But thank youu will kept that in mind. I found that happened to my niacinamide from the ordinary
1593938887.0,1,I have it for almost 2 months and a half now and it has the same colour and consistency. I keep it in the fridge and I don't use it so often now that it's warmer. Maybe once a week. But I used it 2-3 times a week when it was colder and  I guess because I didn't open it so often little air got in and it was better preserved. Also the fridge part.
1593911117.0,2,Thanks a ton

1593923841.0,2,"Kate makes an amazing eyeliner,  Super Sharp Liner EX. I've tried pretty much every great eyeliner and one one handles the best and creates a film, so it doesn't transfer (also hooded lids here). it's blacker than Dollywink, which is my second fave."

1593953146.0,1,"I second this. Clio is the winner. Never smudge, perfect tip and good longevity. During the super hot summer days it does smudge a littleee bit but surely 10x better than Urban Decay imo."
1593953566.0,1,Omg Flowfushi Moteliner/Uzu is amazing! I wish they shipped to Canada 😭
1593895839.0,21,This is possibly my worst nightmare
1593927349.0,16,"For what it's worth, I think the reason people with basic routines have good skin is because people who have naturally good skin wouldn't have elaborate routines in the first place. I hope that made sense?

As for my simple routine, it would be oil cleanser, moisturiser, SPF."
1593904503.0,14,"If it’s only three products, then there’s no room for anything except oil cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen, for obvious reasons. Those who use the most basic probably have no issues to tackle in the first place, hence just cleanse, hydrate and protect.

After watching skincare on those with FP4 and higher, I decided to revamp and rearrange my routine to minimize irritation while battling sun spots. However, without my various prescriptions, it’ll look like this:

AM: water rinse, P20 Kids sunscreen 

PM: Chifure Washable Cold Cream, Zeroid Intensive Oint-cream or Eucerin Roughness Relief 10% urea"
1593899790.0,10,"My picks would be CosRx Good Morning Gel Cleanser, Purito Unscented Centella Sunscreen and Iunik Beta Glucan moisturizer (if I could also use a summer moisturizer i'd choose La Roche Posay Toleriane Sensitivo Fluide). Those three things could very well be my whole routine and I wouldnt miss anything essential."
1593896881.0,6,"Hada Labo foaming cleanser, Hada Labo Perfect Gel, and Skin Aqua UV super moisture gel. Those give me everything I need, and for my oily skin those three are good for both summer and winter. Ideally I’d add in DHC Deep cleansing oil for a double cleanse, but I don’t find this sunscreen difficult to remove with just the 1 cleanse. Anything else is nice but not absolutely necessary. Easy peasy :)"
1593912643.0,5,"My skin care is simple. I don't want to buy or do too much to my skin when I don't need to.

I use a cleanser, vitamin c, moisturizer then sunscreen. It's 4, but gotta use sunscreen.

PM cleanser, retin-a, moisturizer. 

I'm more focused on using what I have vs buying new stuff."

**Routine AM**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash -**    a very, creamy and hydrating face wash. Removes any leftover oil    cleanser and remaining makeup I may have on my face. Simple and    effective, been using this for years now and buy in bulk from Holland    & Barrett.

**Purito Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence -**    this is my fourth re-buy! It's really very hydrating and has   noticeable   brightening effects. The texture is slightly thick - it   does not run   through my fingers so it's not watery. I just press it   into my skin  before applying the emulsion. It's really a very good   essence!

**The Plant Base Nature Solution Hydrating Bamboo Emulsion -** a nice layer of dewy moisture as a prep to the rest, which is exactly what my skin needs.

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream -**    super dewy and super moisturising, holds really well under my   concealer  as well. Slightly sticky texture and has some fragrance in it   but it's  the last ingredient on the list and is not overpowering at   all.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream -**    I use the same moisturiser day and night as I have very dry skin due   to  using tret for anti-ageing purposes. This one is a dream I want to   it  eat it. It's truly hydrating and has the most gorgeous texture.  Dewy   finish.

**Canmake    Tokyo Mermaid UV Gel SPF50 PA++++ or Purito Green Level Unscented Sun    SPF50 PA++++ or Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Moisture Cream SPF 30 -**    I alternate between the three sunscreens depending of whether I'm    inside (SPF 30), outside dry day (Purito) or outside humid day    (Canmake). All three sunscreens are broad spectrum, fragrance and    alcohol free and no white cast. All three have semi-dewy and dewy    finishes, zero white cast. I'm tanned/medium brown so I love these.

**Routine** **PM**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil -**    a thick yet runny enough oil specific for dry skin. Easily removes    makeup and sunscreen and lathers into milk. Washes off clean and leaves    no residue.

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream**

**A-Ret Gel 0.025% -**    gel form, spreads nicely on skin and works wonders. I've been using    retinols for a long time and started using tret last year for    anti-ageing. The upgrade is serious and my skin is like glass with this    bad boy.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream**

**On No Tretinoin Routine PM:**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**REN Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic -**    contains some fragrance but again low on the ingredients list. I    saturate cotton pad and press it in all over my face and neck. I use the    leftover on my legs, helped with my strawberry leg a ton and my legs    are all glowy I kid you not! Has mild exfoliating properties which  helps   with my flakes from the tret. Skin is all a-glow!

**The Plant Base Nature Solution Hydrating Bamboo Emulsion**

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream**

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream**"
1593790766.0,12,"How do you manage to minimize the irritation when using tret and the Ren AHA? I use tret too and I wanna add an exfoliant so bad, but I’m scared of damaging my moisture barrier"
1593792000.0,7,How did you reduce the irritation from Ren? I have eczema so I have dry and sensitive skin but man this would irritate my skin for a few minutes idk if that’s normal
1593800088.0,4,Does the canmake sunscreen lean more to the matte or dewy side? I currently use the purito unscented spf and thats a dewy finish
1593803536.0,3,Have you thought about putting the tretinoin on after your moisturizer to reduce dryness? I heard that’s quiet popular.
1593792933.0,2,"love the purito fermented complex essence too! it's a really nice texture and not irritating for my oily comedogenic-prone skin at all :) one of my best finds from online shopping during lockdown, lol"
1593788903.0,1,Thoughts on the Sukin cream?
1593796319.0,1,Although I’m located in US wanted to know where do you purchase your A-retinol from ?
1593796820.0,1,"Oh, I really want to try the Dr. Organic face wash, Scinic eye cream, and Sukin night cream. I'm always trying to find very moisturizing, fragrance free skincare."
1593799373.0,1,Is the Sukin cream really good ?
1593804990.0,1,Can I ask where you got the can make and Purito sunscreens from please?? I’m moving to the UK in the next few months and want to make sure I can get them :)
1593806123.0,1,I have been eyeing the **Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream** .  I was waiting for reviews to try it.  Sounds like you really like it.
1593820029.0,1,Did you have to get the A Ret gel 0.025% prescribed to you?
1593817334.0,2,I have REN and wow I’m definitely gonna try it on my legs also.
1593799180.0,5,"I don't use tret every night. One night I use tret, and one night I use REN. I need it because my skin flakes with the tret. However, I believe the REN is gentle enough for daily use on its own, so I doubt it would wreck your skin barrier if you follow with a good serum, moisturiser etc. I normally finish my REN night routines with a face oil as an occlusive too. Other than the tret flakes from time to time, my skin is super healthy and bouncy."
1593798595.0,5,"I would avoid that Ren toner if you have eczema because I do and used it once a day for 3 days straight and I got the worst skin irritation. It was bumpy, itchy and irritated for awhile and my skin is still textured from it. And I never get eczema on my face! My derm told me to use cortisone cream to fix it. 10/10 would not recommend"
1593799017.0,2,Yes I do get slight tingly/prickly feeling on my skin for a few seconds but it goes away after that. I even feel it when I apply it on my legs haha! My skin is more dry than sensitive though so maybe it's a bit worse for you? :(
1593802270.0,3,I would say a semi-dewy finish. More like a 'natural' skin finish.
1593804056.0,2,"Yes I used to do that and I also used to mixed the tret with my moisturiser and then apply it on. But I built up tolerance over the years and now apply it straight to my skin and just buffer it with moisturiser on top after five minutes. My skin is not crazy flaky anymore, it's past that point but it still flakes from time to time so I just gotta keep on top of it."
1593798946.0,2,It's so good and totally underrated!
1593789004.0,1,Sorry forgot to include my review in comments!
1593798874.0,10,From alldaychemist.com they ship worldwide
1593796830.0,3,You can use curology in the US. I just get it from my primary physician and my insurance covers it. If you’ve got a doctor available it’s worth it to ask because curology is pretty expensive
1593798918.0,1,They are all stellar. That Sukin cream OMG the dream. The Scinic eye cream is gorgeous but does have a little fragrance in it!
1593802328.0,1,It is SO good. I just bought five more jars from iHerb haha I'm so extra.
1593805116.0,1,"I bulk buy them on Yesstyle but I believe they ship almost worldwide. UK has free shipping for all orders over £60. You can also get them on eBay, sometimes for cheaper but sometimes for more so I always double check before I place my next order. Welcome to the UK :)"
1593849386.0,1,I have very dry skin and this feels very hydrating and so pleasant to apply. Nothing harsh in it and no fragrance but smells lovely too.
1593849233.0,1,No I buy it in bulk on alldaychemist.com
1593849264.0,1,"Yes I thought ""why not"" and liking the results!"
1593799267.0,2,Yeah I tend to only use it once and week thinking my skin would get used to it. Never did :(
1593799286.0,2,Probably lol. You live and you learn in this example hahhaag
1593839359.0,2,Now im going to buy it! Thanks OP
1593798893.0,1,Thank you :)
1593797032.0,4,Yes I’ve been using Curology for past 3 years and my skin has gone from night to day . Now that they allow you to manage your shipment date I’ll usually order big bottle every 3 months. Trying to be a little stingy here but this shipment rate works for me. I don’t have a doctor for skin and was wondering If this cream was available over the counter in US. Thanks :)
1593805750.0,1,I’m curious how you get it from your physician as it’s a private company with their own doctors. I have never seen language on their site about that option unless it was just recently added. Curology isn’t an option for everyone unfortunately ... Something in the base cream disagrees with my skin ☹️ but it works well for my daughter.  🙂 I’m curious about the gel option though so I’ll have to put that on the list of questions for my annual physical!
1593799634.0,2,Whyyyyy do they do that? My eyeballs do not need to be perfumed. No-one is going to sniff them.
1593807657.0,1,Thanks so much! The yesstyle shipping fees to Canada end up being so much more than the cost of the sunscreen and all I want to do is try Purito! Canmake is my go to right not but looking to add more for different days like yourself. Thanks for the help!
1593902324.0,1,Thank you.  This helps
1593797634.0,2,You cannot get tret without a prescription in the United States
1593806535.0,3,I don’t use curology anymore. I see my doctor who gave me a prescription for tret that I pick up from the pharmacy for $5. It’s a better option for me cost wise though obviously insurance coverages vary so it may not be as affordable for everyone
1593802295.0,1,"Ugh I know, but I was surprised it even had perfume in it cause I can't smell anything!"
1593849318.0,1,Do you not have a minimum order to buy for free shipping? I just buy extra essences and emulsions to get to £60 as I know I will use all of these anyway.
1593797728.0,4,Ahhh.. my Curology prescription has 0.009% tret  with 1% azelic acid and 9% clindamycin and that formula keeps my skin clear. I’ll stick to Curology for now. Thanks :)
1593807610.0,1,Ahhhh that makes sense - how it was worded made me think you were getting *curology* from your doctor but you’re getting just tret - got it!
1593863773.0,1,"They just announced free shipping on orders of $185, someone in another sub confirmed it was because of covid. Looks like I'm going with ebay!"
1593871819.0,1,Blimey. Hopefully it gets better after Covid. Used to be minimum £30 for UK before the virus.

1593826939.0,50,"I've used both, but I sincerely believe that there isn't a lot of meaningful difference between a toner/serum/essence/ampoule. Technically the labels can indicate things like texture, viscosity, or concentration of ingredients, but it's all really wishy-washy as there are no labelling rules and there is a lot of crossover between products in these ""categories"". I don't really pay attention to the product name and focus instead on the ingredients and what I want those ingredients to do.   

So, for example, if I want to incorporate niacinamide into my routine, I look for products that have 4-5% niacinamide and then look at things like price per mL, texture, other ingredients instead of focusing on whether or not I am looking for a toner or essence."
1593826822.0,16,"The names are super arbitrary. If I want some panthenol in my routine it makes no difference if that panthenol is coming from a toner or an essence. I don't care about the arbitrary marketing terms. I only look at ingredients. Both toners and essences are watery layers that can deliver some beneficial ingredients into the skin. The ingredients I look for in a toner/essence: Amino Acids, Licorice Root, Centella Asiatica, Green Tea and Aloe Vera.

Essences are marketed as being more concentrated than toners, (and serums are marketed as being more concentrated than both) but I haven't found that to be the case at all.

For example, the 2sol Cica Youth Toner contains 10% panthenol. I haven't found a single serum, let alone an essence, that contains that much panthenol. Even the Cos de Baha Panthenol serum (a panthenol centric serum) contains only 4% panthenol.

Another example, the Cos de Baha Niacinamide Toner contains 5% Niacinamide, whereas the CosRx Galactomyces Essence contains only 2%.

So in summary, names don't matter. Ingredients and concentrations thereof are the only things that matter.

I also take issue with the identification of essences as being more viscous than toners, which is sometimes how they are differentiated. I've used toners that are more viscous than essences and I've used essences that are more watery than toners.

All that being said, my favorite essences are Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence, Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence and Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose Edition.

My favorite toners are 2sol Cica Youth Toner, Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, Benton Deep Green Tea Toner and Isntree Aloe Soothing Toner."
1593823428.0,6,"I like using the SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner from Etude House (sometimes more than 1 layer of it patted on the face) and the fermented mugwort essence from Missha when my skin needs some extra hidration. But I don't really use them together.

I also have one of the hyped toners from Biologique Recherche - it was recomended to me by a esthetician that works exclusively with this brand, but I've never used is often enough to check if it really forks for me.

&#x200B;

Also, Leah Yoo on skincare stuff we don't really need:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8) She explains what toners and essences are"
1593822014.0,8,"I have and use both.

My skin type was combo oily, but it's basically normal now (slightly acne prone).

My skin adores the extra hydration. I usually layer on 3 - 4 watery toners/essences with varying ingredients and purposes. But for me, skincare is more about relaxing and enjoying my time than just another necessary step in hygiene, like brushing my teeth or something. 

Current HG is the Utena Magiabotanica Hatomugi Skin Conditioner. I spritz this on multiple times throughout my routine just because. Very lightweight, hydrating, and mildly soothing. 

Other favorites: 

- Siorus Time Is Running Out Mist, I love this one almost as much as the Magiabotanica. I will often use it with just sunscreen afterwards on very lazy mornings. 

- Primera Miracle Seed Essence, new favorite. My skin was already in good shape and this product managed to make it better.

- I'm From Rice Toner, I've been a bit neglectful with it lately, which still means using it nearly every night but only some mornings. Amazing texture and a lovely brightening effect."
1593823787.0,3,"I’ve been using only an essence + serum + moisturizer since the start of quarantine and my skin has actually been really happy. I usually use 2 layers of essence when I have more time (let it soak in more). I’m finishing up the May coop one and then I’m going to go back to the innisfree soybean energy essence, which I already finished off a bottle of.

I have combo skin and used to use both (plus other steps) and I think my skin just does better with less steps."
1593844014.0,3,"I use both. I have dry dehydrated skin so I like using as much as I can. If I had to pick one, I'd choose essence. I really love the Cosrx Snail Mucin essence. It makes my skin hydrated and plump. I currently use the I'm From Rice Toner and it's moisturizing and also sinks into my skin. I want to test the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner next and see how it compares to the I'm From one which I love."
1593860724.0,2,Depends on what you use afterwards. If you are going to use serum or moisturizer afterwards then toner will do. If not then it's better to use essence. Essence is more concentrated version of toner.
1593853657.0,1,"I have and use both. I have combination oily skin with breakouts on my red days which usually leave dark spots.

My favorite hydrating toners are the unscented klairs supple prep toner and the aromatica hyaluronic acid toner. I use 3 layers of my toner and apply each layer after the first layer is absorbed. I find that this method makes my skin smoother and plumper in the morning.
For essences my favorite is the Nacific Niacin essence, I like using niacinamide in my routine but I don’t like the tacky feeling I get from niacinamide serums and this one really faded my dark spots fast.

I think that using both won’t hurt but you have to find essences that work for your skin and your needs because some essences have the same ingredients with some toners. ❤️"
1593868928.0,1,Both but I treat my toner as fancy water.
1593828873.0,9,"Yeah I agree. It doesn’t make any sense to ask “toner or essence” because different toners/essences have different properties, and hence everyone has a difference idea of toners/essences. There’s no standard so it’d be more helpful to reference what properties you’re looking at instead, e.g. watery, more viscous, ingredient concentration."
1593843635.0,3,Just curious what results you get with the 2sol toner? And is it sticky with that much panthenol in it?
1593847276.0,2,"2nd this. Ive jumped on the hype trend of 1st essences, toners, essences and after stacking them one after another in a routine, honestly its just a hydration layer that you need. If your skin is saying you dont need so many layers then you dont, simple as that. (Which is what my skin told me) So now I'm left with 4 toners and 3 essences that I'm trying to finish using one at a time, struggle is real 😂"
1593865696.0,1,I have the Benton deep green tea toner right now and I'm really enjoying it. Only thing I hesitated with when getting this was lack of preservatives but caved in the end because it did sound like an anti-inflammatory dream! The Isntree Aloe soothing toner is on my list to try too.
1593877720.0,1,"Do you think the keep cool and soothe bamboo toner would be suitable for a dry/air conditioned environment? Tried to get my hands on the 2sol toner but because of covid, it's near impossible :("
1593891188.0,3,"It's not sticky at all surprisingly! Mostly robust hydration, meaning, long lasting ""deep"" hydration (unlike Hyaluronic Acid, for example, which doesn't impart long lasting hydration for me at all.) Also plumping and moisture barrier maintenance. But my favorite thing is that it's super hydrating while being basically weightless on the skin.."
1593874627.0,1,"Are you me??!!  :) :) I have all sorts of stuff to finish before I am allowing myself to restock/try stuff (wallet cries silently in the corner) and when I layer them one by one, my skin looks a baby which is full but is still being fed boiled carrots and is about to throw an angry fit!!"
1593866011.0,3,Ya I really really wish Benton formulated with preservatives. But there's something about that toner though! I couldn't stop reaching for it..and it's so affordable.
1593866687.0,3,"Isntree Aloe is more hydrating I think 🙂 just so you know. Actually Isntree Aloe is just as hydrating as Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, which I thought was the most hydrating waterweight toner until now. I LOVE it."
1593888501.0,1,"Yes. The Keep Cool is very hydrating, but depending on your skin you might need to layer.

Are you sure you can't get 2sol?

https://www.ebay.com/itm/183543484360

(It was $22 when I purchased.)

You can also get it here with free worldwide shipping.

https://bestbeautip.com/products/183543484360"
1593869792.0,1,"Okay that actually sounds really good, thanks for the feedback, don't really see anyone else talking about it 🙂 yeah the Benton isn't that hydrating but it's okay for the summer months, feels kind of refreshing so I don't mind it for now."
1593890633.0,1,"A different ebay seller I was in contact with stated it would be extra shipping cost and they didn't know how long it would get here. I'll have to check out the 2 sites you linked. Out of keep cool and 2sol, which do you think is better for hydrating skin? My skin can be sensitive and prone to redness. I've tried other toners and essences that seem to have only a short time of hydrating my skin and some I think made my skin drier no matter the method I was applying them: Klairs Supple Toner, I'm From Mugwort Essence, Acwell Licorice Toner, and Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence.Thanks so much for your input :)"
1593890805.0,1,"Are you applying moisturizer after essence and toner?

I think the 2sol is more hydrating but the Keep Cool is more soothing. Also I love Keep Cool because it's EXTREMELY versatile. It can be used anywhere in the routine for added hydration."
1593891201.0,1,"Yes I've been applying them right after moisturizer. I've tried light and heavier moisturizers too with no avail. My skin is hydrated after but then within an hour or two, my skin feels tight and flaky. I bought the LRP Lipikar Balm based on your recommendations and my skin is still flaky. I'm trying not to add too many steps to my routine, but I think an essence, toner, or serum will help with the hydration piece since moisturizers aren't really made for that. Appreciate your input!"

1593823540.0,9,"At the moment the only product I am using of theirs is the No Sebum mineral powder. This is a staple for me and will replace when it finishes. 
I have used the Blueberry sunscreen and will buy again once I have access to it, as well as trying other products from that range."
1593818920.0,5,"I've only ever tried the hyaluronic acid serum. It's just that, good quality varied molecule sizes of HA, and nothing else. But it was well priced and the bottle was ginormous"
1593839339.0,3,"**skincare**

• green tea seed serum: a basic hydrating serum,  there are probably better ones out there; but it feels so instantly cooling and refreshing, and also worked wonders on refining the appearance of pore and sebaceous filaments on my dehydrated skin. there is a pretty distinct fragrance, though.

• volcanic pore clay mask: super gentle, comfortable mask that doesn't dry out my skin; it definitely takes consistent use, but it's so inexpensive and lasts long. using a thin layer a couple times a week gently clears and smooths skin in the long run.

• my real squeeze sheet masks: they have a huuuge range and are pretty inexpensive, i especially like the honey, pomegranate, oatmeal, and rice ones.

• personally ive never tried this before, but my super oily, acne-prone friend swears by their sunscreens

**makeup**

• eyeshadow singles: ugh i love their eyeshadows. the mattes are smooth and pigmented (by asian beauty standards), definitely on the dry side but not too powdery; but the glitters are my favourite: they vary in intensity but are all stunning. you can also buy one of their little magnetic palettes to slot your singles into.

• twinkle glitter liners: they're fine, they're nice. small tipped, full pigmentation, an intense shimmer that dries down nicely. it amps up any look effortlessly.

• eyeliners: the always new auto liner was kinda dry on my eyes, didn't like that one much, but their gel liners are pretty smooth and pigmented! i wish the tip was a little thinner, but that's just personal preference.

• microcara: formula is okay, dry type of mascara, but the wand is what makes it so special. it is perfect for if you have tragic lower lashes (like me) or if you want a very natural and defined lash look. i saved the wand and use it with other mascaras when mine dried up. i use the skinny longlongcara. it also comes in a smaller tube!

• blushes: not my favourite, but they're nice, basic, buildable blushes for that veil effect. soft smooth powder, they also have a cream formula; in a nice range of wearable colours. pretty matte, though. but i like the pan blushes better than their liquid ones, which are a bit too natural for me.

• vivid cotton ink: super pigmented, soft velvet; can be worn opaque in one swipe, or blotted down to a sheer flush that won't transfer, which is my favourite aspect of it - the formula is so manipulable like that, and it's so creamy that its perfect for mixing colours. blends nicely on the eyes and cheeks. beautiful colour range too. not drying if you prep your lips beforehand. doesn't have a traditional stain. pretty strongly scented, but fades on application.

• i think discontinued so i'll keep this short, but the creamy vivid tints: juicy but thin, glossy, long-lasting stain, gorgeous colours, i cri, bring them back innisfree

• i don't usually use loose powders, but they're no-sebum mineral powder is very mattifying."
1593819580.0,3,I really love their lip balms! Particularly the canola honey lip balm
1593821583.0,3,"Volcanic clay mask, so soothing and refreshing."
1593825985.0,3,"I like the Minimum Serum for Sensitive Skin (it's been renamed to Gentle Care for US region). It has 8 ingredients, no fragrance, and feels quite hydrating without being sticky or greasy. It's a *boring* product (lol) but one that I use pretty often when my skin is feeling sensitized or when it's feeling dehydrated.



Their Green Tea Seed Serum is very popular but it unfortunately did not work for me. I actually did like the scent but a lot of people hate it (it's pretty strong tbh). It was lightweight and gave me a matte finish, but I broke out in whiteheads and PIE from it. I was pretty sad about it."
1593820984.0,5,"Their clay masks are very popular. I liked their lipsticks too. Just ordered the new fruit tint thing. The blurring powder was pretty decent, I used up a tub of the loose powder and am now onto the pressed. Eyeshadow can be hit or miss, I really like an old formula from a few years ago but not their recent stuff. The blueberry watery sun cream has one of the nicest finishes I've tried from a Korean sunscreen. 

Edit: their green tea stuff smells nasty. It's the same smell as a lot of cheap Korean ""green"" products, including the saem harakeke line. I wouldn't buy it without sniffing it first."
1593819511.0,2,"Love all their mists. Canola honey lip balm is also great, as is the fermented soybean oil"
1593821775.0,2,"I use their Matte Mineral Setting Powder on my hair as a dry shampoo, it does a wonderful job in decreasing the oiliness of it's appearance.

Hydrating Green Tea Cleanser was pretty gentle on my face and the price point was reasonable. Their oil cleansers get the job done as long as you don't mind it being heavily fragranced.

The Green tea seed serum as well, does its job, nothing too exciting there.

Recently I've been in love with their hand creams, especially the Dawn Hoji Cha scent, smells just like milk tea.

Overall, lots of good products but nothing exceptionally wow-ing. I can count on it to not break me out or strip my skin during cleansing though!"
1593839264.0,2,"\- Auto eyebrow pencil. It's cheap and lasts forever. The color's good too. 

\- No sebum mineral powder. Cheap and effective.

\- Green tea seed serum. I've actually stopped using this, but it was all right, if strongly fragranced. 

\- Super volcanic pore clay mask. Came back to this after trying out the Missha one (also partially because there was a BTS BT21 box set)."
1593831216.0,3,"Used to love innisfree. It's one of the brands from my earlier AB Journey. I liked Jeju Orchid Enriched Eye Cream, and Cream, the Volcanic Clay Mask, and their sheetmasks also good.

But now that I'm in the journey to fragrance and essential oils-free, I cut innisfree out of my regimen. Because it's a brand that loves putting fragrance and eo in the products, each line has either one or both."
1593819796.0,1,"I love their eyeshadows, lip tint and blush"
1593820533.0,1,"I love their lip gloss, cant remember the name but it's all named after tea... smells amazing and is just enough color. I use their orchid face lotion as well, smells really strong but my skin loves it."
1593821505.0,1,"It's a great brand for those starting out in skincare. My brother has oily acne prone skin, and he uses the clarifying skincare set. And I enjoyed their makeup, esp the skinnycara, when I was a teen. It wasn't pricy and wasn't too difficult to use. My current faves are their clay mask and their Orchid cream."
1593823584.0,1,I really like their soybean energy essence! I have combo skin and I use that + a serum + moisturizer/sleeping pack and that’s basically my lazy routine and it works really well for my skin.

1593841734.0,1,"The cherry blossom tone-up and jelly creams are both very heavily scented and felt really cold on my face, not a nice experience at all.

I know that a lot of teenage Korean girls are obsessed with the brand though (my experience from doing an exchange to Korea, when announced that there was an Innisfree shop nearby, they all freaked out)."
1593845023.0,1,"I recently got the Olive Real cleanser, and like it a lot as my first cleanser step. I had the Klairs Gentle Black oil cleanser before that. The Innisfree one feels less oily, and I like how it makes my skin feel better than the Klairs one."
1593845276.0,1,"Some of the products are definitely too heavy and has caused me to break out a few times since my skin might just be too sensitive. 

However, my favourite product is definitely the valcano exfoliater. The greentea cleanser is also really nice as well for once a day use. 

One of the most overrated products for me was the green tea serum which caused me to break out badly :("
1593847303.0,1,Tried their green tea cleansing foam. Downside is the scent too overwhelming. Good thing is it doesn’t make your face dry and dull.
1593849451.0,1,"Innisfree Bija Cica Skin is my favorite product from them and my favorite toner/ essence in general.

Others that I like are green tea lip sleeping mask and green tea lip balm.

I'm also currently testing bija trouble mask and no sebum mineral pact."

Im iffy about probiotics in skincare(does it even work wtf) but the blend of squalane, cermaide, cholesterol and green tea in this bad boy keeps tret dryness at baaaay. I love how it leaves a bit of oil on top that fades after a while, really moisturizing but not too creamy goey in my humid climate.


My mom loooves the orchid line. She finds it super moisturizing for her dry and mature skin."
1593877848.0,1,"Their sunscreens in the long lasting and mild formula are some of my favorite sunscreens. I prefer mild formula over the long lasting though bc the long lasting formula caused some small breakouts. Their no sebum powder is also nice, minimal scent. I want to try their bija cica cream."
1593949852.0,1,I love their Cherry Blossom Dewy Glow Mist!! It’s smells like candy but the scent is so faint and I believe it’s fragrance free (correct me if I’m wrong). I don’t know how dewy and glowy it makes you tbh but it moisturizes my skin throughout the day and doesn’t make me feel greasy or immediately dry my skin out which is what I typically feel in other facial mists. I tried using it as a toner and it wasn’t that effective but I love it as a facial mist.
1593833756.0,0,"Just so you know, their products are scented. They do add artificial fragrance, so if you have sensitive skin try their sensitive line.

1593824670.0,1,"Oh i see, i hope they haven’t discontinued the blueberry line!! :("
1593872021.0,3,"Hi!

It's not! I'd say look for cleansers of a pH ranging from 5 to 6 with 5.5 being ideal.

The human skin has a pH of 5.5 so it is considered ideal for cleansers to be of the same pH so as to not strip the skin too much. I've heard good things about innisfree blueberry pH5.5 cleanser.
My personal favourite is heimish all clean green foam pH5.5!

There are many pH balanced cleansers in the market, always check the pH prior to purchasing the product! This goes for all cleansers except for oil/balm cleansers as oils don't have a pH.

Hope this helps!"
1593863361.0,1,"I’m not 100% sure, but I think the blueberry line is a South Korea exclusive which is why it isn’t listed on the international website. I got my cleansers in the physical store in Korea (bought two and used it up already) but can’t find it in any physical store here. 

Best bet would be to buy from third party sellers like roseroseshop or jolse. Or Shopee if you’re from South East Asia like me :)"

1593820904.0,5,"KOSE Softy Mo Deep Treatment oil: I have used the other version of this oil and I love it. But wanted to give this a go after reading some reviews about it that stated “if you massage the oil onto your skin for about 5 mins you’ll start to feel it pull out dirt and other pore clogging impurities from your skin.”

HEIMISH All Clean Green Foam Cleanser: I have been looking for a good cleanser without any fragrance and essential oil to replace my Dr.Brandt Clean Biotic pH balanced yogurt cleanser w/chlorophyll and one that won’t cause problems to my moisturizer barrier. This was a highly recommended product by Kelly Driscoll on YouTube. 

MELANO CC: I have seen a lot of people rave about this product so thought I would give it a go since it is targeted to correcting discoloration and PIH on the face."

1593906075.0,1,"Best facial oils for dull, acne prone skin?"
1593907588.0,1,"A few days ago a bunch of large red blotches appeared all over my face (cheeks, forehead, and nose except for my eyes) but I didn't notice it until two days ago, I've been trying not to look in the mirror too much to not be obsessive about my skin.

My mom said that it's probably an allergic reaction to one of the products I've been using, but I've been keeping the same routine for the past half year or longer.

* Cerave foaming facial cleanser
* Krave Great Barrier Relief + SoonJung 2x barrier intensive cream (I started using this two weeks ago after not using it for a few months)
* Melano CC (in the morning)
* [Acne.org](https://acne.org/) Benzoyl peroxide (in the morning)
* Tretinoin 0.05% (at night)
* Sunscreen: UV Aqua Super Moisture Milk (I just started using a new bottle a few days before this happened)

My skin has definitely been pretty dry and sensitive, probably due to the tret I'm on, although it's already been a year since I've gone on it (it's helped somewhat but I still get frequent breakouts unfortunately), so I only use the BP two or three times a week on my breakouts.

Anyways, have any of you experienced something like this? I don't think it makes sense that it would be an allergic reaction considering I've been using the same products for a while now, and my neck also suddenly got really dry and itchy even though I don't use products on it (I know I should). But, there is a clear border around my face and my eyes where the redness ends, as if I was wearing a red face mask.

Thank you so much for the help!"

The middle section is the best information"
1593910432.0,1,"Kinda sounds like some sort of contact allergy- not necessarily from one of your products, but perhaps something inadvertently got on your hands before you touched your face/neck. I haven’t had that happen to my face, but I’ve definitely had it happen elsewhere- not just from obvious things like touching plants either. One time I carried groceries from costco from the car in one of the cardboard boxes they have available...the inside of my forearms got super red, blotchy and itchy! Apparently one of the dyes or chemicals on the box was not something my skin could tolerate even for a couple of minutes.

If you can’t recall touching anything unusual, I would say maybe just monitor for another few days and see if it improves. If it’s getting worse, then discontinue anything potentially irritating at least for a couple of days and just use moisturizer/stay out of the sun. It’s ok to take a day or two off of tret if your skin is angry, and give your skin a break to heal. If it still doesn’t improve, I would seek advice from your dermatologist."
1593922681.0,1,"I haven’t tried but based on their [return policy](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/returns/help/section.html/hsi.736) only unopened ones can be returned, sorry!

1593878349.0,1,"I‘ve placed a couple of orders in the first week of April and none have been shipped or given any form of update yet (except that the option to cancel the orders became unavailable after 30 days passed). I fully understand, because back then there still was free shipping and it was taken away shortly after, so it would’ve probably been too expensive/impossible for them to send it out at the time.

Last Friday they sent me an automated mail that Standard shipping ($2,50) to Germany is back and I promptly put in another order, as I’m running really dry on supplies, but since then nothing has moved I’m starting to get a bit antsy of more stuff sitting there for months and better sales on other websites coming and going (again), which would be especially frustrating now that the shipping is paid.

I’m sure they’ll send everything as soon as they can, I‘m just trying to soothe my nerves 🙈 if you say orders before the pandemic typically took about a week though, I suppose I can stay calm for now regarding my new orders at least!"

Sheet mask? Nah, totally nice to use after acids."
1593925994.0,1,"Tret can definitely prime your skin to be reactive, so I wouldn’t be surprised if something that by chance happened to contact to your face/neck could kind of cause it to flare up unexpectedly. Ever since starting tret I have taken to applying LRP Cicaplast at any sign of redness and that seems to solve any problems I have had, if you happen to be able to get your hands on that it’s a very handy thing to have around! But yes, until you can determine whether you are experiencing irritation or a contact dermatitis of some kind, tret and BP would only exacerbate either of those so it might be good to take a break."

Works beautifully with absorbing excess oil and doesn’t leave anything anything on the brush (meaning no sunscreen is coming off). I also remain that way for a few hours as I am of oily skin and I’m in a very hot/humid climate. I just ordered the Missha sebum cut powder as a much cheaper dupe and I really hope it delivers!

I also like Barry M dewy finish setting spray, contains polyvinylpyrrolidone which is a great film former so I feel like it keeps my sunscreen in place (doesn’t do anything to mattify though so I use it on top of the By Terry powder). Not sure if it’s available outside the U.K. but I’m sure any setting spray with PVP would do. I’m sure Labmuffin has a video on which ingredients to look out for in setting sprays"
1593896353.0,1,Lots of people I follow apply the color science SPF powder over there makeup/previous sunscreen with little disturbance. I am reassured that my SPF isn’t moving by allowing 10ish minutes for the sunscreen to settle into my skin before applying the powder.

1593834370.0,-4,"Omg Me! I recently bought about 20 mask sheets and it turns out I get breakouts everytime I use one.

For skin dehydration I suggest layering your toner or essence. Use humid climate to your advantage, use hyalauronic acid! It pulls water from the environment to keep your skin hydrated."
1593938503.0,1,"Yes, I think so too! I've not had acne for years so I might try to re-visit the products I used to use and I might try the Mugwort toner!"

The natural pigmentation of my lips are pretty dark, so something I struggle to find are products that give me that somewhat lighter blush/coral-y with the perfect translucent gloss. Similar things I've tried in the past just made me look *crazy*. The color would either be too light, or the texture is too goopy, and it just never looked natural.

But this is so pretty and easy to apply. The staying power is meh, it's the kind of thing you'd have to reapply a few hours later. But imo worth it given this is the first time I've achieved this kind of color on my lips"
1593743909.0,63,Currently obsessed with your lips. They're like *perfect* for showing off a lip product.
1593698567.0,22,"i agree! i bought #04 nudy tender rose and #01 peach punch red sometime last year and i still use them often now! they're so nice and feel great on my lips. i initially thought peach punch red would be too light for me since my lips are also a bit dark, but it wasn't at all! they feel like creamy lip tints at first but over time, the water rises and it feels more like a lip oil without the oil? it's so different! the only issue is that it doesn't leave much of a tint after it's gone, but it's so pretty that i can't complain much even on that lol."
1593725493.0,4,Wow that's lovely. I want to try one of their tints now!
1593734287.0,3,I’ve had the same issue with wanting a natural look and I instantly added this to my cart. Fingers crossed it looks as good as it does on you!
1593745384.0,9,Omg your lips are perfect
1593746820.0,4,This looks like an ad. I'm a guy and I'd try this.
1593711334.0,2,I’m also so obsessed with the smell! I can’t put my finger on the scent exactly but it smells so good.
1593717680.0,2,That is SO pretty!
1593738588.0,2,Looks beautiful!!! Where do you buy yours?
1593750039.0,2,i want to try this!
1593776728.0,2,"Omg, those look amazing !"
1593874944.0,2,"What a lovely colour, texture and dewy look!! Loved this, surely gonna try. Also you should be in the beauty ads, (no offense intended). Seriously you can try many more colour and texture ranges as they will really suit you! Also may I ask if you are wearing any lip balm underneath this shade?"
1593720947.0,2,Ooh this is so pretty! Does it have a fragrance and is it transferproof?
1593748680.0,2,Your lips are sooooooooooooo pretty; also that color looks super good on you as well!
1593745251.0,1,"This is so pretty! I have similar coloring to you, so I’m definitely adding this to my list! Also you have the prettiest lips :)"
1593748289.0,1,I suspect the Sephora Collection Jelly Melt Glossy Lip Tint is made from the same manufacture that makes the Milimage tint. Both have some similar based ingredients.

1593771312.0,1,Name of this product?
1593817449.0,1,"I've tried peach punch red, Grapefruit mix orange, and both were great. The peach punch red is a red with just a hint of warmth to it. I used that for about 6 months and then purchased grapefruit mix orange, which is a more warmer, orange red. The best part is that I don't need concealer around the edges of my lips, the tint works well on bare lips too."
1593876211.0,1,Does it fade true to colour or into hot pink? Does it wear more like a water tint lr a gloss? I also have pretty dark lips but this looks wonderful on you!

1593738615.0,3,Thank u!! Yesstyle!
1593732727.0,3,"There's a light fruity scent to it it. I haven't tested it properly to say for sure, but I do find my lips stay moist for a while, and the overall lasting power isn't that impressive, so I wouldn't consider it transferproof!"

1593698188.0,32,"Good question, that's the other nice thing about it! It doesn't dry in that sticky gross way nor does it dry me out and get gross and flaky. I've had it on for about an hour my lips feel nice and soft. The gloss is gone but the color is there and its pigmented in a rly wonderful natural looking way"
1593732597.0,9,Thank you!! The translucency of the tint makes it super wearable imo so you should give it a shot!
1593749343.0,8,I have to agree. Your lips really need to be in beauty ads. I’ll bet the rest of you is simply angelic.

1593790592.0,3,"i'm neutral toned! i use #04 in the winter when i'm more on the cool side, and #01 in the summer when i'm more tan and warm. #04 looks gorgeous on cool tones."

1593676727.0,173,Hahaha honestly your dedication to eliminating tour makeup routine is inspiring. How long does your semi permanent eyeliner / liptint last?
1593668408.0,211,"Hi all! Wanted to share my results after 3 years of not wearing makeup and 2 years of taking good care of my skin. I was really unhappy with my skin before (very textured, fine lines, uneven) and would wear foundation to hide it. Entering my early 30s inspired me to change my ways and I went makeup free. My friend introduced me to Korean 10 step skin care 2 years ago and that really made a positive impact on my skin. My only regret is not paying attention to skin care in my 20s!

Please note: Yes, I am 100% makeup free. I was serious about ditching makeup. I got semi-permanent eyeliner tattooed, eyebrows microbladed, lip blush tattooed. I was *really* sick of putting on makeup after 10 years of doing it daily. I haven't used foundation, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil or lipstick in years.

Here is the list of skin care products I'm currently using:

1) Oil-Based Cleanser: Innisfree Green Tea Cleansing Oil

2) Water-Based Cleanser: COSRX Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser

3) Exfoliator: Deciem Glycolic Acid (7%) Toning Solution (use only 1x/2days)

4) Toner: Issntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner 

5) Essence: Sulwahsoo First Care Activating Serum

6) Treatments: Deciem The Ordinary ""Buffet"" Serum

7) Sheet Mask: Any sheet mask from Innisfree or Mediheal

8) Eye cream: Deciem Hylamide SubQ Eyes

9) Moisturizer: Deciem The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA

10) Daytime Sunscreen: Neutrogena Hydro Boost SPF50
Nighttime Sleep Mask: Sulwahsoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask EX

I have to admit I'm a bit thrifty and I often swap out more expensive products (Sulwahsoo) with slightly less expensive (Innisfree). One day Sulwhasoo, another day Innisfree. It helps the expensive stuff last longer for me. Two things I absolutely adore and work so well for me: Deciem Glycolic Acid (7%) Toning Solution and Sulwahsoo Overnight Revitalizating Mask EX. The glycolic acid solution zaps my adult acne breakouts ASAP and putting on the Sulwahsoo night mask means in the morning I have plump glowing skin. Please note I'm not a skin expert, I just found a routine that works for me and wanted to share. Hope you all have a great skin day ❤️"
1593670734.0,26,Stunning results! Just wanted to know how to you use the glycolic acid? Spot treatment or full face?
1593675655.0,22,"Wow! I remember when Michelle Phan announced she no longer wears foundation. I feel this!!! Looks amazing! Oh also, would you say the hydra boost night cream would work for dry acne prone skin too? Is it scented? Thanks!"
1593673840.0,17,Amazing results! I have a couple of questions about the semi-permanent makeup if you don’t mind me asking. How long after you got the makeup tattooed was the photo on the right taken? And how much did the procedures cost? The makeup looks fantastic!
1593679052.0,13,You're 34?! Do you do anything for anti-aging?
1593673385.0,5,"Wow, thats amazing! You seriously just gave me so much hope on adjusting my makeup and face routine 😍"
1593674562.0,4,You look incredible! Your skin is glowing and amazing! Congrats on this skincare journey :)
1593678985.0,5,Whoah your tattooed makeup looks so good! You look amazing 💗
1593676222.0,5,"Wow! Do you do every step daily? Twice a day? Or alternate days? I’m very curious, since I also have textured skin. You look great, and the semi-permanent makeup does too!"
1593678329.0,4,What does semi perm lip tiny entail? Is it similar to tattooing?
1593735838.0,3,I admire your dedication!! Your skin is glowing. ✨May I ask what your skin type is?
1593696806.0,3,Your skin looks absolutely fantastic! I would have guessed you were early 20s if you hadn’t specified your age!
1593705368.0,3,"You look so good!!! Would you ever consider lash extensions?

I totally feel you on foundation btw. It was really hard for me to give it up, and I had refused to believe that stopping it would make my skin better.. but since I had to stay home due to 'rona, I stopped wearing it everyday.. and bam! My skin has gotten so much more even, less oily, less flaky, stopped breaking out as much, etc."
1593679363.0,2,Your skin looks incredible! Where do you find all these products in Canada?
1593691123.0,2,"so gorgeous!! someone i know got the semi-permanent eyeliner and she said it hurt a lot, how was ur experience? i haven't started using make up yet but love the idea of not having to bother with eyeliner"
1593692118.0,2,I saw that you said you’re Canadian and got lip tinting done for $200. Do you mind me asking if it was in the Ontario GTA area? Also was the lip tint put on darker or lighter shade lips? I’ve been looking o to getting my lips tinted too because of hyperpigmentation on the top lip but I can’t book a consultation due to COVID restrictions still.
1593692210.0,2,good job
1593702189.0,2,OMG saving this asap... your skin looks AMAZING. Did you experience any hormonal acne in your 30s? I’m in my early 30s and experiencing hormonal acne now but had clear skin in my 20s :(
1593711831.0,2,Does lip blush mean you get your entire lips stained or just like the lip line you’d normally use a lip liner on?
1593713717.0,2,Do you know how long it would take the semi permanent liner completely go away if you don't touch it up?
1593714096.0,2,"wow, agreed that you skin looks amazing  - i love the make up free look!  having said that, do you find the 10 steps sustainable?  i've recently found that paring down to 4-6 steps is much more manageable and my skin looks just as good, sharing my new found routine here in case it's helpful to anyone:  [https://seoulofskin.com/blogs/habits/ditch-the-k-beauty-10-step-routine](https://seoulofskin.com/blogs/habits/ditch-the-k-beauty-10-step-routine)"
1593716095.0,2,Wow this is amazing! I’m 22 and I wish I had your skin. What is your skin type? I’m thinking of saving your routine and I love how you swap out more expensive for less expensive!!!
1593717328.0,2,Do you use a sheet mask everyday? You look incredible! And I can only imagine how good you must feel in your skin.
1593721021.0,2,"OP, if you don't mind me asking, you have super faint eleven marks between your eyebrows and they've disappeared! Do you use any products that you feel have helped with this? Your skin is major goals!"
1593722569.0,2,Love this! I just reached the point where I no longer feel a need to use any foundation either 💙
1593725628.0,2,"You are my goddamn hero. 

I’ve been really interested in getting eyeliner and brow tattoo work done. Working from home and hardly wearing makeup has really made me realize just how excessive my routine was! It looks lovely on you, and I’m taking your tips above and running with them."
1593733372.0,2,Hey! dumb question but what do you mean when you say you use the glycolic Acid toner 1x/2 days!!
1593733651.0,2,You look gorgeous 👍
1593733878.0,2,Beautiful
1593740982.0,2,I’m so curious on the lip tint and have been wanting to get mine done! How was the peeling? Are you getting it touched up every so often?
1593803632.0,2,Wow you go girl!!! Its my dream to completely eliminate makeup usage
1593710182.0,1,Do the circle lenses come in prescription only?
1593681344.0,1,Wow! Beautiful.. but what is eyebrow micro blading?
1593691297.0,-17,How can you be makeup free if you have eye make up on
1593678492.0,97,"I swear it's one of the best beauty decisions I made for myself. Saves *so* much time and no more raccoon eyes from smidgey liners. Semi-permanent liners typically last 1-2 years. With good skin care habits and well hydrated skin, it can last even longer. However, they do require touchups if some spots start fading."
1593682299.0,17,"I have always wondered, is cleansing oil only for removing makeup? Do you do both one after another since you don't use makeup now?"
1593708003.0,6,Deciem says not to use the Buffet & Glycolic acid in the same routine though 🤔 has that been ok for you? I want to introduce peptides but been confused with Deciem's warnings about conflicts with AHAs :s
1593697345.0,2,How do you like the Hydroboost? I thought about getting it but it had a weird smell.
1593708593.0,2,"I love Sulwhasoo FCAS and Overnight Mask. I also have their Radiance Energy Mask. I tried their TimeTreasure overnight mask, but that one broke me out unfortunately."
1593712017.0,2,"Your skin looks fabulous!  I love to invest in a good skincare routine as it means having naturally glowing skin.  I luv your dedication to having great looking skin.

I really like masks.  Are there any other sleeping masks that you recommend?"
1593671419.0,21,Thank you!! Full face except my eye area. I have naturally oily pimple prone skin so full face exfoliation once every two days is a must to keep breakouts to a minimum. 👍
1593677539.0,19,"Thank you!! When i turned 30 I realized no matter how much foundation I put on, it didn't do anything to hide fine lines or rough, dehydrated skin texture. Just got so sick of hiding my skin. So for the 10th step, during the day I put on Neutrogena Hydro Boost sunscreen. I honestly love this sunscreen because it helps to seal in all of the hydrating serums and creams. It's lightly scented and leaves your skin glowing. As for the night time, instead of putting on sunscreen, I put on Sulwahsoo Revitalizing Mask. It works well to nourish and hydrate the skin at night while you sleep. It's lightly scented and smells of ginseng. What helped me with acne control is using the glycolic acid exfoliator once every 2 days. Hope this all helps!"
1593674692.0,52,"The after photo is about 2 years into having semi-permanent tattooing done. I get touched up once a year or so. I'm from Canada and the eyeliner was $400, microblading $350, lip blush $200. For me the time savings (saves me 30 mins every morning), being rain-proof and cry-proof made it totally worth it. Feel free to ask any other questions, super happy to answer."
1593679879.0,14,For me the entirety of 10 step skin care itself is anti-aging. Some of my major concerns were fine lines and sallow skin (both signs of aging). Those concerns basically disappeared as soon as I started making sure my skin is hydrated. I think as I get closer to my 40s I'll have look into more intensive anti-aging products.
1593689500.0,5,"Though not AB, The Ordinary's Buffet has helped me, who's around OP's age, with the anti-aging part - some of the fine lines and sallow skin that OP mentioned, and also toned down some stubborn redness around my nostrils. This is on top of an improved skin after finally dealing dehydration a couple of years ago."
1593673857.0,6,"It's so worth it! Not having to wear foundation was a total game changer for me. No more touchups, no more melting makeup, way less clogged pores, too!"
1593674875.0,6,Thank you so much! Really want to show everyone it's never too late to start taking better care of your skin. I have better skin now in my 30s than I ever did in my 20s.
1593678111.0,5,"Thank you very much! I try to do it twice a day but I have to admit i will skip the sheet mask if I'm pressed for time (which is pretty often). I feel like if you cheat a few times a week and reduce the steps it's totally ok too. On lazy days I might skip a cleanser, skip sheet mask and exfoliation. Still works out fine in the end 😆"
1593678940.0,10,Yup! Artists use a tattooing machine especially designed for semi-permanent makeup applications. It can hurt a little or a lot depending on the area being tattooed and pain tolerance. Tattoo artists will apply a numbing gel/cream to reduce discomfort. Good artists will also make sure they sketch out the shape first with lip liner so you can get the lip shape you desire. Always do your research and go with knowledgeable professionals!
1593737499.0,3,"Thank you!! Well hydrated skin glows from within, this was something people told me and I was too stubborn in my 20s to believe, but it's so true!! Before, when I neglected my skin, I had super oily skin that broke out a lot. My T-zone was so oily it didn't matter what primer or foundation I wore, the makeup would start sliding off mid day. Now with good skin care, I'm combination skin with a slightly oily T-zone and normal skin everywhere else on my face. Hydration totally changed my skin :)"
1593706122.0,5,"Girl let me tell you, I had eyelash extensions done every month for 2 years back when I was younger. It was really awesome at first and a huge thrill to actually have lashes. But after a while I just got tired of not being able to rub my eyes or sleep with my face in the pillow. I've come to terms with my itty bitty tiny lashes. Short lashes are ok for me! And congrats on having better skin, I hope you continue going makeup free past COVID! Enjoy that natural healthy glow :)"
1593680187.0,6,"They are available at Walmart and most of the larger Asian supermarkets carry Korean skin care products. If I can't find them there, I order from YesAsia. Shipping can be a total pain tho."
1593697034.0,2,"Out of all of the semi-permanent procedures, the eyeliner was the most painful by far. I have decently high pain tolerance but I still broke out in cold sweat from the pain. The artist reapplied numbing cream and it helped a little, but overall it was definitely not a comfortable 2.5 hours. Despite this, it was so worth it for me; my oily lids and teary eyes meant any eyeliner I've ever used *always* smudged a little. Drove me nuts! I used to have to pop into the bathroom throughout the day to check and fix racoon eyes. Those days are OVER :D"
1593698097.0,4,"I'm on the west coast in BC. I was really lucky to have found an experienced microblading and eyebrow tattooing artist who had just learned lip blush and was needing models & pictures of lip blush work for her portfolio. Usually lip blush would cost at least double the price, around $400 in my area. It was a risk to go with someone new to the technique, but her microblading and eyebrow tattooing portfolio was so impressive I decided to give her a try. She honestly did a really good job using light colors to reduce the look of brownish pigmentation around the border of my lips. I also requested an ombre effect with the center of the lip more intensely pigmented; it resulted in a more ""stained"" look, which was what I wanted. I know with some very darkly pigmented lips, the 1st appointment could be spent lightening those areas, then a 2nd appointment (after lips have healed) is needed to add color. Hope you get to have your tattoo soon!"
1593809380.0,1,"Thank you! Yes I do get hormonal acne right before my period, it's always concentrated around my jawline and lower cheeks, drives me nuts. I find pimple patches do a really good job getting them to shrink quickly and also heal quickly. I've tried COSRX pimple patches and they do wonders for me. I think with hormonal acne there's just no way to prevent it so the best option is to treat it quickly and shorten the duration. Someone please correct me if I'm mistaken!"
1593719523.0,2,"Likely many years, but it would gradually fade to a greyish color as the body breaks down the pigments and would look awful. I'm 10 months out from my last touchup and honestly the tattoo is still very dark. I'm guessing I could go 2 years without a touchup before it starting to look noticeably faded."
1593738204.0,1,Yessss. I did the math. I wore makeup nearly every day for 10 years and it would take 30 mins in the morning to put on my face. I've spent nearly 2000 hours over my life time putting stuff on my face that clogged my skin and dulled it! I turned 31 in 2017 and the thought of another 20+ years of wasting 30 mins a day doing makeup made me die a little inside. I hope you get your tattoos! You're going to love how awesome it is to just wake up looking put together <3
1593737614.0,2,Not a dumb question at all! Glycolic Acid is a pretty effective exfoliant and should only be used every other day. They really recommend against using it daily as it could cause irritation and redness when overused. Hope that helps!
1593743692.0,2,"I had it done to correct hyperpigmentation (darkness) around the border of my lips and a red tinted for a healthy natural look. Super highly recommend it. Now i just apply lip balm and good to go! The peeling was awful, not gonna lie. At one point i was telling my friends it's like i wet my lips and dipped them in a bag of panko breadcrumbs. Just weird bits of dry dead skin all over that you have to resist peeling. I get my lips touched up every year :)"
1593743919.0,2,"These specific ones I'm not sure, mine are prescription. I'm 100% sure you can get similar circle lenses without prescription, though!"
1593695460.0,5,"If you read her comment, she said she got semi-permanent makeup done. Those are tattoos"
1593699810.0,21,How did you find your aesthetician? I’ve been considering semi permanent make up since I do my eyeliner and eyebrows the same way every day
1593700634.0,10,"Hi, your skin looks great! I actually stay makeup free as well besides eyeliner and a little blush, where do you go for semi-permanent eyeliner? Like a makeup artist, esthetician, etc. Is it like a tattoo? How is the procedure and is it expensive?"
1593742215.0,2,What was the eyeliner tattoo experience like? Did it hurt? Did you bleed?
1593683685.0,52,not OP but it would help in removing sunscreen too
1593687874.0,9,"As a guy, I’ve just started to use oil cleansers and I’m really surprised at the result. I always feel like I’m getting some oil gunks out of my skin when I use it 2-3 times a day."
1593702107.0,5,"Even if you don’t wear makeup, it’s beneficial to use an oil cleanser because it helps unclog pores and get rid of excess sebum"
1593864866.0,1,Thanks all so much for replying! I've learned like a whole lot of information just from this post hahaha. I have always only used a normal facial cleanser even when I wear water-resistant sunscreen (Biore UV Aquarich) and I am just starting on my learning journey in skincare. I am gonna get an oil cleanser to try out soon! ♥️
1593719233.0,6,"You smart cookie! Yes I had noticed the clash of Buffet and glycolic acid, so what I do is alternate products. I do glycolic acid every other day, and on the days when I'm not using it I apply Buffet. On the days I do use glycolic acid I grab whatever sample serum I have in my drawer and use that. I have a ton of KR skin care samples and I found this was a good way of using it up. Thank you for asking so I could have a chance to clarify!"
1593707935.0,1,"I love hydro boost and have been using it since last year. It does a good job sealing in the moisture of all of the serums and creams I layered on before applying sunscreen. I adore the glow it gives me, kinda like faux glass skin. I tried some JP and KR sunscreens but majority of the ones I tried would leave my skin with a white cast that i really didnt like."
1593719324.0,1,"Overall, which one was your favorite? I'm on my 2nd tube of Revitalizing Mask. Soo addicted to the ginseng smell 😆"
1593720200.0,2,"Thank you so much. I was honestly inspired by my skin care guru friend and she held my hand through the entire process and helped me pick out items. She's been doing Kr skin care way longer than I have and her skin is sooo smooth. We motivate each other in maintaining good skin care 😊

1593705014.0,49,"I feel you. It's the same reason why I got all the tattooing done, it really became a chore doing the same makeup everyday. I found my aesthetician through a lot of research on IG. A year prior to booking the appointment, I had been keeping tabs on aesthetician portfolios. I only ended up considering aesthetician whose portfolios got considerably bigger over the year and who had a ton of good reviews. Try using hashtags to your advantage to see local artists, for example, #torontomicroblading or #newyorkmicroblading, etc. A good artist who is serious about her craft will post a lot of high quality before and after pics & videos."
1593705694.0,16,"Thank you! There's a lot of independent semi-permanent artists who rent out space to do their tattoo work, much like regular tattoos artists do. Your best bet is to look on IG, as most serious artists are using that plarform as a portfolio for their work. Try using hashtags to your advantage to see local artist in your city, for example #torontomicroblading. The procedure for eyeliner is very similar to tattooing; they prep and numb your skin, then use an electric tattooing pen/machine. It hurt a *lot* and was $400 2 years ago. The convenience, for me, is 100% worth the pain and the price tag."
1593745053.0,3,"Hurt like crazy despite numbing gel! I actually broke out in a cold sweat from the pain haha. It's a bit unsettling to have someone poking at your lash line so close to your eyeball. It took a bit over 2.5 hours. There was no bleeding at all, thank goodness. Despite the pain and big price tag ($400 not including tip), I would 100% do it all over again and I won't go back to using eyeliner again. That's how much I love the results."
1593685835.0,6,"Ooh! Thanks for replying, aren't water based cleansers good enough? I actually just use my facial cleanser to wash everything off, have I been doing it wrong all this time?

If I use an oil-based cleanser, do I use it before my normal facial cleanser?"
1593700296.0,15,I'm no expert but I don't think you should use it that often. A water cleanser is enough in the morning to cleanse after sleep (or just water tbh) and then oil cleanser +water based cleanser in the evening to remove makeup and/or sunscreen.
1593719994.0,2,Ohh ok hehe i was gonna do that too and hoping that the peptide will still be effective even if i miss it the 1-2 times a week i do AHA (i can't use it in the morning as i use Vit C then daily).
1593787449.0,1,"I like them all. But if you need some exfoliating effect, radiance energy mask is better. It's thick, but not it never broke me out. Revitalizing Mask is also fine. Do you use it every day? I usually end my routine with Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Cream EX, and only use the RM about 1-2 times a week. I'm still on my 1st tube I bought last Sept.

BTW - if you want your pores to look small almost immediately, try Sulwhasoo Clarifying Mask (its' their peel off mask). Your pores look smaller instantly and the effect will last about 2 days minimum. It's the only peel-off mask that I think is worth the time & hassle."

I seriously Luv Asian skincare!   It has made such a difference in my skin.  Prior to this I use to skip the toner and apply facial oil which only led to dry skin.  My Chinese friend taught me a lot about water and hydration for skin prior to moisturizer and from there I started researching which led to my current Asian skincare fascination.  I have found amazing Asian skincare products which don't exist in the Western world.  The ingredient decks amaze me as they don't seem to include as many filler and cheap ingredients to stack up.  

The 7 layer hydrating toner method has improved my skin's hydration drastically and I'm only thankful.  

I enjoy conversing with other individuals who take their skincare just as serious!"
1593720502.0,5,"Oh god, I struggled so badly with acne until my mid 20s. I had so many scars, which contributed to me thinking I needed to cover my skin with foundation. Thanks, cosmetic industry. 😡 It took a few months to figure out what works for me. Luckily I have a friend who is big into KR skin care so we research and share new products with each other. Having a skincare buddy is so awesome."
1593676235.0,54,"I'll break it down for you by procedure :)

Eyeliner: Hurt like crazy despite my artist being super careful and using a lot of numbing cream! I actually broke out in a cold sweat from the pain. Wouldn't recommend for someone who has very little pain tolerance. My eyes were crazy swollen the next day but by the 3rd day the swelling had gone down significantly. Then came scabbing and peeling and itching for a week or so. Not bad! 

Microblading: I fell asleep during this procedure. The only odd sensation was the feeling of the blade scratching into skin to make the individual hair strokes when the numbing cream was wearing off. Eyebrows go through a crazy dark phase, then it peels and itches, then the pigments fade. It takes about a month for the true color to show. Definitely a complicated healing process.

Lip blush: I fell asleep during this procedure as well. With lots of numbing cream it just felt like a gentle vibration on the lips as the artist worked. The healing process was similar to microblading, just more uncomfortable because our lips have more nerve endings. The peeling lip skin drove me nuts lol"
1593676466.0,19,It's especially great for those of us with oily lids and watery eyes. I kid you not I could not find an eyeliner that would stay on for more than a few hours. I was just so dang fed up with having to fix it when I'm out.
1593720959.0,3,Thank you so much! My liner artist is Tess Marti @tesstattoo on IG. She's AMAZING. She's highly sought after and books months in advance. My lip blush and microblading artist is Jen @grand.arc.jen. Super awesome artist as well.

1593743859.0,3,"Yes, that's right. Also, be careful of what serums you use on days when you use glycolic acid; the active ingredients in glycolic acid mess with serums and boosters that have a lot of peptides, rendering the serums ineffective. Also, only use it at night, never in the morning. You don't want sun (UV light) on glycolic acid on your skin!"

I also use it under my arms occasionally to remove deodorant, because I find it builds up even when washing with body wash daily! Oil cleansers are really great."
1593696692.0,10,"Oil cleansers are used before a water based cleanser because it needs to be applied on dry skin. For some people, an oil cleanser is all they need. But most people go in with a water based cleanser after an oil cleanser.

Oil cleansers break down sunscreen and makeup better especially if you use water resistant products. Most sunscreens and makeup are water resistant by nature and contain silicones/polymers that would not wash away cleanly with just a water based cleanser."
1593739779.0,3,Personally I find using an oil based cleanser first doesn’t dry out my skin like some other cleansers (that I use to take makeup & sunscreen off) would
1593700472.0,7,"Yeah, I have very oily skin but I usually really just use it at night and a water cleanser in the morning.

Ive heard horror stories of using stencils for brows or *freehanding*. You shouldn't ever have anything on your face freehand tattooed!

PhiBrows is international and i'm pretty sure they have artists all over North America. BTW my eyebrow artist is Jen @ grand.arc.jen on IG.

1593703141.0,8,"Some oil cleansers would trigger fungal acne. I’m not too familiar with the oils that do not trigger fungal acne. But I would assume that jojoba oil based oil cleansers or mineral oil based oil cleansers would not trigger fungal acne. The former being technically a wax that is closely similar to our own oil and the latter being a synthetic product.

Oil cleansers unlike the oil cleansing method contain an emulsifier that help wash away the cleanser. The emulsifier is trigger by water which is why oil cleansers are applied on dry skin. There is no residue left after the cleanser is rinsed off.

The benefit of oil cleansers is that most products that need to washed off the face are water resistant but not oil resistant. Oil cleansers help break up the bonds and lift the product from the skin. Then the water activates the emulsifier in the oil cleanser and it gets rinsed away. Thus leaving you with clean skin. Like all products, not all oil cleansers are made equal. Some are more suitable for certain skin types than others."

First of all, I do not like it.

The goods- Longevity is good it can last up to 8 hours. The coverage is very nice all my acne scar got covered !

The bad- It feels fairly thick on the face. 
It leaves a greyish tone to my skin, doesn’t seems to fits well even after sometimes. 
It contains fragrance (but I don’t mind much)
Lastly, it breaks me out! After the first wear of a day I got 2 pimples popping out, I’ve tried it again on the other day and it happened again. 

I personally do not like it or recommend it at all! I put so much hope to it since everyone is raving about it. A bit disappointed."

1593755697.0,4,"Hello everyone! long time lurker, but finally decided to focus a bit more on skincare. So I need some help on product recommendation/routine building.


I'm male in early 30's. Skin type is combination (leans more towards oily; Fitzpatrick IV). I live where it's somewhat humid in the summer, but drier in winter. I have some slight acne issue and blackheads here and there.

I currently only have one routine as I don't use make ups. Here's the products I use:

* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* SKIN 1004 - Madagascar Centella Asiatica 100 Ampoule (this is a recent addition)
* CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
* Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra-Light Sunscreen Fluid SPF 50 (I only use it if I go outside which is minimal these days)


On Product Recommendation
I'm trying to find new products I can try that can deal with acne/blackheads and slow/prevent aging. I saw some products being mentioned here, but without knowing each poster's skin type and condition, I'm a little concerned to try new things (I have no preference on AB/non-AB, but I do wanna try more AB products).


On Routine Building
I try to keep my routine to a minimum, but I don't mind adding a few more steps if it's beneficial. I saw in the wiki it's recommended to have two cleansers. I'm not sure how applicable this is to me. However, whenever I use sunscreen, I feel my current cleanser doesn't clean completely.


Thank you so much in advance!"

I have large pores in some areas, and an uneven skin tone because of the dark spots leftovers from the acne. I would just like a product that could help me with my acne, and also encourage skin regeneration to get rid of my dark spots and even out my skin tone. Does anyone have any recommendations for this?

For rough skin, maybe something for exfoliation? You could totally make a homemade sugar scrub for this! Find a little jar of some kind and mix in equal parts sugar and coconut oil (you don't need much of either one), and you can add something like vanilla extract to it for a nice scent. But something like this can be harsh on skin and should only be a weekly thing. For a gentler exfoliation, Banila Co. Clean It Zero Balm is really nice. e.l.f. Cosmetics also makes an exfoliating scrub that's really nice and not too pricey (like $5).

If the rough skin is due to dryness, something moisturizing would be great! There are soooooo many moisturizers out there! I personally really love Hada Labo Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream, Tonymoly Chok Chok The Green Tea Watery Cream, and Scinic Honey All-in-One Ampoule if you want K-Beauty.

I can't speak for anyone else, but when I think of an ""everyday"" palette, I think of neutral and nude colors - so like beige, tan, brown, copper, and so on. But there's also nothing that says you can't wear neon purple or mint green every day either.

Personally, I lean much more toward subtle shades because bright colors look terrible on me and I find many palettes offer a large enough variety of shades that they can serve as an everyday palette or for more special occasions. I know I haven't seen a ton of more wild colors from K-beauty brands - I see a lot of nude, coral, maple and occasionally smoky colors.

To give you an idea of what I consider ""everyday,' the palettes I currently have and use on a regular basis are:

* Smashbox Cover Shot palette in ""Matte""

* L.A. Girl palette in ""The Nudist""

* Romand Better Than Eyes palette in ""Dry Buckwheat""

* Custom peach palette from Colourpop

* Huda Beauty palette in ""Nude"" (this was a gift, but it has a lot of pinks and glitter in it)

It just depends on what I feel like wearing, but I think any of them could be used for any occasion!"
1593779430.0,2,Haven’t tried it yet but I read great things about Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV
1593816809.0,1,"Hmmm, that's a tough call. I know in the US, the highest concentration you can (allegedly) get without a prescription is 2%. However, this may be different for non-US products.

Looking at the ingredients list, retinol is the fourth ingredient out of eleven and I don't know if Korean ingredients lists work like ours do, but if they do, it would imply that retinol is the fourth most prominent ingredient in this. 

That doesn't necessarily mean that it has tons of retinol, but out of the active ingredients, there is more retinol than anything else. That's a good thing. It also has 4.3 out of 5 stars on Amazon out of almost 3,000 reviews and anywhere else I've read shows similarly positive reviews.

I can't say for sure if it actually has that much retinol, but a lot of people sure seem to like it! It seems like it might be worth a shot - I might buy it myself if I wasn't already using tretinoin. If you don't like it, you could always sell/swap it on /r/asianbeautyexchange!

1593819651.0,1,"Never tried it, but Yeouth is a legit US brand, so they can't get away with lying about their ingredients. It doesn't specify the type of retinol used though, so it's difficult to say how ""strong"" it is.

1593790930.0,1,"I struggle with the like perma-bumps around my eye area too!  But I second the potentially harsh. A couple weeks ago I started doing retinol (Sunday Riley’s Luna oil) 2x a week in addition to 1x a week TO’s AHA/BHA and my skin started feeling cranky a few days ago (a little tight, sting-y) so now I’m putting that on pause to focus on soothing/hydrating. I think once my skin feels normal again I’ll try 1x retinol and 1x exfoliate, or like 2x retinol and every other week swap one of them out for the AHA/BHA. Good luck!!"
1593819188.0,1,"The tiny bumps that never go away sounds like milia, which is a trapped build-up of keratin. They can be caused by using products that are too emollient around the eyes. You might need a dermatologist or esthetician to safely extract them. I don't think that milia respond well to most topical treatments. 

As for incorporating retinol, you can just alternate nights with your AHAs. It's fairly easy because you need to build up using retinol slowly anyway. Maybe leave off AHAs the first week, and try not to use actives for a day or two after you've applied your retinol until your skin is accustomed to it."

It doesn't seem to have a significant matte finish, but it's also not greasy feeling like some sunscreens. This is my go-to sunscreen since Biore went and changed their Bright Milk formula to be *more* greasy. (note: I also have oily skin).

I've also heard that Missha All Around Safe Block Soft Finish Sun Milk is a very good choice for oily folks. I haven't tried it yet personally, but it looks promising! And it comes in a larger container than many Korean sunscreens."
1593813234.0,3,"First start by using a gentle cleanser I personally am using zero purifying balm as my oil cleanser (when I use spf/makeup) and the innisfree blueberry rebalancing cleanser as. But the corsx good morning cleanser alot of people love (though it might be drying), and also the soon jung whip cleanser is a favorite among many. 


I'd advise you to not go for a physical exfoliator/wait on exfoliating because this can cause more redness depending on if you choose the wrong one. Toners you can also wait on until you decide how long you want your routine to be  top two toners are pyungkang yuls essence toner, and dear klairs unscented toner.  

For serums/essence its super important to find out what might irritate your skin (alot of people are sensitive to tea tree for instance) afew ingredients to look for are: centella, snail mucin, niacinamide.  Afew serums/essences that are very popular are:
-Benton ultimate snail serum
-cosrx 96 snail mucin essence
-purito unscented centella serum
-missha time revolution essence rx. 
There are so many great ones but it's super important to see what ingredients suit your skin. 


Next I'm going to moisturizers known to help calm your skin/reduce redness these are just afew.
My top choices are:
-Jumiso have a good cream with centella and snail
-Dear Klairs midnight blue calming cream
-Purito centella green recovery cream
-soon jung 2x barrier cream
-iunik centella gel cream
-Benton goodbye redness centella gel

Spf:
-purito unscented centella sunscreen
-cosrx aloe soothing sun cream
-dear klairs soft airy uv essence spf
-presonally I've used misshas sunblock daily and it worked well for me (but this one is definitely not as popular) 

Miscellaneous:
-Benton goodbye redness centella mask I swear this mask instantly calms my skin.
-Benton snail bee masks

It's always best to do your own research and compare what ingredients your current skincare products already have in them. For instance if your current products contain snail, or tea tree or honey and you do not break out/ are not sensitive to these ingredients your skin can most likely handle them. But as always make sure to test new products (dont just rub all over) to insure your skin can get acclimated to whatever product/ingredients you introduce it to. I hope this points you in the right direction to some products/ingredients to look for. Wishing you the best on finding the products that best suit your skin!"
1593870282.0,1,"The Galacto Niacin Essence has 5% Niacinamide, which is enough to give some oil reduction, but galactomyces are mostly known for brightening. The Centella Buffet has 3% Niacinamide, which is less likely to help with oil production, but it has Centella. That can help with redness. Niacinamide is a natural anti-inflammatory too. It sounds like the buffet probably fits your criteria more despite the lower Niacinamide %."

1593869614.0,1,"Niacinamide works well with tret but so does Azaleic Acid, which is an extremely mild exfoliant that’s gentle enough to prescribe to rosacea patients. It does a little of what a BHA and an AHA do by getting down into the pores and exfoliating surface skin. It’s definitely an option if Vit C and normal AHA/BHAs don’t work for you. Most find it gentle enough to use alongside tret. For example, I had a prescription subscription that included tret, AzA, and Niacinamide, and I really liked the combo and felt they balanced each other well."

1593799563.0,1,Thank you! Yeah i usually have really oily skin. Hence the need for lightweight moisturizer. Plus i use toner + fte + serum so maybe that might be enough hydration? I’m definitely more inclined to give it a try now! Thanks :)
1593800111.0,1,Ohhh 12 dollars for an 80ml is amazing!! I think ill get both this and the sunjung and see which works best. Thank you!
1593807683.0,2,"Never heard of this brand before, thank you! I’ll read up on it!"
1593774275.0,2,"I see, thanks a lot! And yes I wear spf on the daily without fail :)"
1593774216.0,2,Hi! I've been using it for 3 weeks or so. Some people have said they've seen quite a lot of changes but personally u haven't:(( ill look into that product! Thanks a lot :)
1593800035.0,2,Thanks! Fingers crossed it goes well!
1593769820.0,2,I’ve been using it for 6-8 months :(
1593807698.0,2,"Interesting! That's the cheap local one (2,95€). I wonder what all those extracts and whatnot in the second one are for... I can maybe see why you'd put stuff like that in a moisturizer but does it have any function in a cleanser when you just wash it off a few seconds afterwards anyways?"
1593915074.0,1,The says its combination (oily tzone) and currently only washes her face with water
1593915103.0,1,She says she has oily skin!
1593781619.0,2,"Yeah it's so hard to tell until you've tried a few products and know what works for you. Ahh I don't really have puffy eyes but some dark circles. I doubt if any of these would give instant results, I just wanna try an eye cream hoping in 10 years time I will look better than I would have 😂😂 thanks for your comment!"
1593791839.0,2,Hello! Thanks for your input! I don't wear any makeup  but should I use eye cream for both AM and PM?
1593823146.0,1,Such lovely colors! I'll consider getting some nude palettes or palettes that I like :D thank you so much!
1593817129.0,1,[deleted]
1593845680.0,1,"Thank you for this!! Will take this into account. Although personally, I don’t think they’re millia since they’re skin colored and tiny!"
1593816142.0,1,I saw Etude on amazon but was unsure! I may just order it now. thanks!
1593827585.0,1,thank you so much! do you use an eye primer when using the clio shadows?
1593912602.0,2,thank you! i'll look into them :D
1593826816.0,1,"Yeah, I guess so. But iirc, even before tret, I already noticed that my face is a different color than my neck so probably it's also another ingredient I'm reacting to. It's also a lot redder irl compared to the photo I uploaded. (I added another photo in the original comment btw) I think the slight whitecast of the milk sunscreen kinda evens or cancels out the redness and made me look pink. Here are the current products I use: 

AM

* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash
* Cos de Baha Snail Mucin
* Cos de Baha Azelaic Acid
* iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream or Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream (depending on how dry I feel and how humid it is)
* Kose Suncut UV Perfect Milk Super Waterproof

PM

* Biore Cleansing Oil 
* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash
* Cos de Baha Snail Mucin
* Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream / Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream
* Gel tretinoin 0.025% (every other night)
* \*sometimes I apply another layer of moisturizer\*
* Petroleum jelly as occlusive (thin layer on places I flake)

Right now,  I think the Biore Cleansing Oil is  a possible culprit too per checking it's ingredients. And i've been using that for few years now. What do you think? I can replace that by Kose Speedy Cleansing tonight since my order already arrived."
1593866468.0,1,I actually tried acids and vit before and after starting bp and tret (I’d been using both for almost a month when I re introduced actives: Cosrx BHA and yes Klairs Vita C) but they wrecked my skin including. I take bp and tret because they’re my golden duo for non hormonal acne lol and even though tret has done a great job at smoothing and lightening newer scars and hyperpigmentation but concern is evening out my skintone from years of not wearing sunscreen as a teen.
1593853758.0,1,"My second cleanser is Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid face foam (after oil) or Garnier Micellar Gel Wash for Sensitive Skin(morning).

My favourite moisturisers (combination-oily skin) are  Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow moisturiser or Bonajour Green Tea water bomb cream.

My favourite toners are Klairs Supple Preparation unscented toner and I'm from Rice toner.

In summer I like a Niacinamide serum (I use 2Sol) to control oil. 

Everything I use is free from perfume, essential oils and drying ingredients."
1593804067.0,1,"In that case, the emulsion might actually be enough for you! It has squalane and some fatty alcohols in it, so even though it's lighter than other moisturizers, it's still heavier than a gel ^^"
1593777338.0,2,"Give it longer than 3 weeks for sure. It takes about a month for skin to turn over, so minium that with daily use."
1593816774.0,1,"I see. In that case, it should be worthwhile to add a Vitamin C product. 

Melano CC is a very popular Japanese product line, especially their Anti-Spot Essence. They have toners, spot treatments, and creams to help fade blemishes. 

There's also the Dear Klairs Vitamin Drop serum. It and the Melano CC serum have a similar lightweight oil texture, although I believe that they are both water-based.

I am currently using the Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot serum. I just got it yesterday, so I can't tell you how well it's working for me yet. But I purchased it on the recommendation of Liah Yoo, founder of Krave Beauty. It was on her ""Products I Wish I'd Formulated"" list, which has been nothing but hits for me so far. 

I hope you find something that works for you! :)"
1593813046.0,2,"I can only assume it is aimed for oily skin with the tea tree oil and betaine salicylate, but your guess is as good as mine as to what the rest does (or if it does anything).


I just look for a a simple cleanser, with low PH, that won't leave my skin stripped. 

I spend more money on the first step and get a good oil cleanser that I massage in for a minute. The second one is just a quick rinse."
1593817651.0,1,"Botanicals with dubious skin benefit claims are an easy way for companies to put fragrance in a product and to advertise it as ""natural"" and or ""clean."" Sometimes they're still good products despite this."
1593919445.0,1,"In that case, maybe you can get her stuff for a basic skincare routine. But please make sure she only tries *one* new item at each time, slowly adding on so she can see how her skin reacts!

1. Gentle basic cleanser - **Etude House SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** ask her to cleanse for 60s for PM, she could stick to washing with water in the AM at first

2. Gentle toners - Benton Aloe BHA Skin Toner (address her rough skin issue - use 2-3 times a week PM) or **Etude House SoonJung 5.5 Relief Toner** (on other days and all AM)

3. Serum - can alternate the ones you got for her - TO Alpha Arbutin+HA or TO Niacinamide with Zinc (only use 1 at first, maybe 2-3 times a week, and slowly build up) These serum step can address her hyperpigmentation issues!

4. Moisturizer - **Tony Moly Chok Chok Watery Cream** (AM) or Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask (PM)

5. Sunscreen (AM) - **Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun Screen**

The ones in bold are what I would suggest you to get for her if there are too many items! I made the recommendations because they are quite gentle and fewer chances of irritating her skin since she hasn't used much skincare before. Hope these help you in planning her birthday gift!"
1593919069.0,2,"I can help out a bit more, in that case! :)

[Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/isntree-green-tea-fresh-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1067993358) is an anti-oil facial toner, so it has a dual purpose. And if you don't mind some non-Korean items, I *love* [e.l.f. Cosmetics Mattifying Lotion](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/elf%2B-mattifying-lotion/91028.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyvmlh5O16gIVBaSzCh3qqQa3EAQYAyABEgLc5_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Matte Blotting Mist](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/elf%2B-matte-blotting-mist/91043.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyvmlh5O16gIVBaSzCh3qqQa3EAQYASABEgLJnPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - both are made with kaolin clay, which helps keep the skin from looking visibly oily for a few hours. They're the same price and either one would be great for oily skin.

Also, some hyaluronic acid is always good. Hyaluronic acid helps to retain moisture, so it's definitely a great thing to use with a moisturizer. [Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Gokujyun-Premium-Hyaluronic-5-7floz/dp/B06X3R1LL3/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=hada+labo+hyaluronic+acid&qid=1593917798&s=hpc&sr=1-5) is absolutely awesome and since you only need a few drops per application (I do one drop on my forehead and one on each cheek), this bottle will last a long time even with daily use.

Sunscreen is also always a good part of any skincare routine. I haven't used a whole lot of different sunscreens personally, but I love [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish](https://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Sunprise-Finish-SPF50/dp/B00WE3XGAC)! It's a little greasy, but not too bad. 

I have also heard that [A'PIEU PURE BLOCK Natural Daily Sun Cream](https://www.amazon.com/APIEU-BLOCK-Natural-Cream-SPF45/dp/B00J2Q5MSS) and [Missha All Around Safe Block Soft Finish Sun Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Missha-Around-Block-Finish-SPF50/dp/B00E9OXJUQ) are good choices for sunscreen for oily folks, and while I want to try them sometime, I can't say for sure how good they are.

A face cleanser might be good too. I love [Garnier SkinActive Micellar Water](https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Waterproof/dp/B019IK3A36/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&fpw=pantry&keywords=garnier+micellar+water&qid=1593918483&s=pantry&sr=1-7) and you can find it at any store that sells lotion (pharmacy, grocery store, Walmart, etc.) But note that if you get this, it really really should be applied with cotton pads, which you can usually find in the skincare aisle too. I've tried using this stuff with bare hands, cotton balls, paper towels and tissues and it really does go on best with cotton pads.

[Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/Biore-Deep-Charcoal-Cleanser-Ounce/dp/B00NQ2SEBG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&fpw=pantry&keywords=Biore+Deep+Pore+Charcoal+Cleanser&qid=1593918521&s=pantry&sr=8-1&srs=7301146011) is good for oil control and also acne. This has menthol in it, in case she has any sensitivity to mint or doesn't like the smell! One little note on oil control products, I think if you use too many of them at once, it can actually cause more oil because the skin tries to make up for the lack of oil, so maybe only pick one or two oil control items for your kit!

And any of those individually wrapped face masks you can find at just about any store would probably be nice too!

And if she needs to know what order to use stuff in, [this link](https://www.dermstore.com/blog/in-what-order-do-i-apply-my-skin-care-products-infographic/) will give a little more info. Also, let me know if you have a particular budget to stick to and I can make some different suggestions if anything I mentioned is too expensive."
1593791937.0,2,You're welcome! It just depends on your preference or how dry your undereyes. I usually wear it day and night but sometimes I forget during the day and it's fine. I use the Cosrx oil free moisturizer on my face and sometimes I just use that under my eyes.
1593818104.0,1,"I don't think I've been using tretinoin long enough to see a major difference just yet, but I do notice that I seem to break out less. And I don't see any *new* wrinkles, so I guess it's doing something! I also tried TO's retinol serums and they didn't do a thing for me.

Also, you can get tretinoin without a prescription! I order mine from AllDayChemist.com for like $4 a tube (compared to $300 my pharmacy wanted) and as long as you don't mind paying $15 for shipping and waiting like a month, it's so much cheaper to stock up this way. There's also r/tretinoin if you want to learn more about it.

But yes, tretinoin is considered a holy grail of skincare because it's the highest concentration of retinol you can get and it has been proven to minimize signs of aging. If you can get your hands on it, go for it! Just be careful because it can cause a little irritation and skin flaking, and be sure to wear sunscreen because retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun."
1593828151.0,1,"Well when i am doin just a simple matte like a wash then i dont, but say i want a better payoff of the glitters then i use my mac or too faced primer.. though i have used them without an eye primer also, like just use concealer as eye primer and that works equally good"
1593827992.0,2,"Okay so here i see the kose sunscreen has alcohol pretty high up , you should try replace that.. wash off treatments in my opinions should be the last that you should worry about, but if you have a hunch switch it out.. the cos de baha products have bunch of extracts in them.. that could also be triggering this redness.. id say strip it down to bare min keep the tret and ato ceramide remove the cos de baha products and change that sunscreen. Do this for a week or two, i think the witch hazel and eucalyptus in the cos de baha might be causing the reaction, plus the alcohol in the sunscreen, with tret, its getting a bit much for the skin to handle maybe.i do like the kose speedy one more, and ive been using that with dhc for 6 years now. I use tret as well and i use the normal soonjung barrier cream before i apply tret, they have more or less the same composition as far as ingredients go so i highly doubt its causing it so you can continue to use it. 
So 
1. Change the suncreen ( see the klairs midnight blue uv essense) has centella and guaziline so a good alternative to the iunik
2. Stop the cos de baha products 
3. Switch to kose
Do this for 2 weeks"
1593870630.0,2,"Bp will not even out your skin tone.. it works on active bacterial inflamations.. tret will over period of time smoothen your skin out.. but you need to give it time... bp should be your sos.. not a daily thing.. when i started using tret i decreased my exfoliation to once in two weeks cause you dont need it much.. but then i would do like the aha bha peel, stayed away from bha toners in general. 
Youve only been using tret for a month is what i gathered so obv if you add more onto it the skin might react.. but trust me you dont have to put on bp everyday it wont do anything for the eveness and will just dry you out
Dont use vit c and bp together either thats a big no
If youre purging then that will pass in 4 weeks or so.. its pretty normal for that to happen.. else you anyways got the niacinamide in, you can get arbutin for the day if you wanna avoid vit c, but please stop the bp all over your face, it will not show now.. but youre just ruining the moisture barrier with bp"

I'll go to a derm soon about an unrelated issue, I'll try to persuade them into giving me tret, thankfully the monthly cream dose will only cost around 2-5 USD, would be much better than what I'm paying for retinol, BHAs, peels, etc haha.

Wish you and your skin the best!"
1593828227.0,2,"Oh boy, I just added Cos de Baha products last month. I think I’ll try to experiment and remove one product at a time so I can finally find the real culprit. Thanks for the advise! Appreciate it! 💓"
1593874008.0,1,I think you missread. I’m been on using bp and tret for 2 years now. Bp is for my acne while tret is for scars. This daily combination is what my dermatologist and I has observed to be most effective and my moisture barrier is fine. A couple of months into starting this routine is when I tried in incorporate actives...so late 2018 and it went badly for me but because I stopped the actives early enough my skin was able to recover quickly. I was just looking for a less invasive hyperpigmentation treatment to accompany tret.
1593872932.0,2,I’ve personally never had milia so I’m not sure
1593874137.0,1,Aah! Apologies.. did you try use bp and vit on alternate days? Irrespective niacinamide is amazing for clearing up skin and works well with tret so that wont bother your skin cause its not really an active..
1593885367.0,1,No problems :)! I did try alternating bp and vit c but I think my skin just doesn't like vitamin c if it doesn't come from food so I've been try incorporate more vitamin c rich food into my diet. Even vitamin c supplements have made my skin freak out. Do you have any niacinamide rich products to recommend?

This is the aftermath of a decluttering session. I love blush so much that I ended up keeping more than I expected. I'm into muted colors, but I like to try the odd color every now and then. 

Here are bite-sized reviews of my blushes:

The SAEM Semi Pro Multi Color
11 Beige
- staying power is the best amongst all my blushes (because it's cream)
- the color is quite pale for me so I usually just use this as a base for a more vibrant blush
- thick in texture, doesn't blend as easily as I'd like it to

too cool for school Check Jelly Blusher 
02 Apricot Sorbet
- has a mochi texture
- to be completely frank, I bought this when I had a coral phase and never touched it again
- a bright, vibrant true orange
- kept it because it's staying power is great and it's applies so smoothly 
- I love the formula, just wish I got it in another shade

3CE Mood Recipe Face Blush
Nude Peach
- I like this blush as a concept (lol) but once I wear it I end up layering too much because it's so sheer
- It's almost a fair skintone color, would recommend for those who aren't really into blushes but want color on their cheeks
- I’ve panned mine already as it's so easy to go through 

Missha Cotton Blusher 
Mama's Camel Coat
- a My Cheeks But Better shade
- a light warm beige that leans tan, not an ounce of pink in it! which I find hard to find in Asian blushes
- has noticeable shimmers in the pan so it gives a healthy glow when you apply it

Etude House Lovely Cookie Blusher BE101 Ginger Honey Cookie
- probably one of my favorites
- a nude-y/browny pink with small flecks of shimmer in it
- (some describe it as an orange pink but I completely disagree)
- the shimmer is not at all noticeable when worn on the face imo
- the pigment is buildable so if you want a strong blush, this is quite apt for that

Missha Cotton Blusher 
Vintage Robe
- this used to have flecks of gold in it but I've used it so much that my pan looks matte now
- I would describe this shade as Romand's Dusty Pink in powder form

Etude House Lovely Cookie Blusher
BR401 Pink Brownie
- A mauve pink that leans cool-toned when I put it on my cheeks
- I don't use it as much bc the shade looks a little off on my warm skin but I see this working well with deeper skintones
- The formula is soooooo buttery and soft! I feel like this formula is underrated in the Asian Beauty community

Romand Better than Cheek
04 Fig Chip
- Love this because it blurs out my pores lol
- One of my faves in formula and color (planning on buying Pear Chip pretty soon) 
- I have to be careful with this because the color is outstandingly vibrant. 
- It's a warm pink with a lot of red in it

Peripera Pure Blushed Sunshine Cheek
01 Calm Pink
- my newest blush! another warm pink with a considerable amount of white base
- Quite powdery but I don’t mind
- I put this side by side with Benefit's Daffodil, and noticed this is just one step deeper to that blush
- The swatch here has about 3 layers, but the actual color when blended out is very soft and pastel

Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks
10 Terra Cotta Fleur
- You can mix the colors to your liking, and I’m still trying to find the right amount of red, brown, and white that would suit me
- Quite glittery on me, I have to be careful bc the shimmers are quite noticeable
- I think it's an essential for my fellow Soft/Deep/True Autumns

Innisfree Jelly Cheek
03 Fig
- another one of those mochi blushers
- I'd describe this as a mauve red, if that color even exists. If you don’t use red blushes, but would like to try some out, this is a lovely color to start with.
- really pretty on the cheeks, completely matte, but somehow I always end up reapplying when I wear this
- I use this so much that its case is completely broken

Ever Bilena Blush On
Willow
- this is a brand from the Philippines
- my most brown blush (with a hint of red when applied on the cheeks), would look great with tan skintones to give off that almost sunkissed look
- There are flecks of shimmer in it, but disappear into a healthy sheen when worn on the face
- not as buttery as my other blushes, but the level of pigment makes up for it
- the packaging is quite flimsy

By the way, if anyone has more blush recommendations that fit into the color scheme I currently have, please tell me :)"
1593759627.0,3,Such a beautiful selection of shades! There are so many shades of the Etude blushers (esp the newly released ones!) I want but the bulky packaging looks like a hassle ;-; Do you find it bulky and/or flimsy?
1593760819.0,3,"This is such a fantastic breakdown! Thanks for your hard work! 

I love the Etude House Lovely Cookie Blushers as well -- so affordable and pigmented and smooth? It blows my mind."
1593836661.0,2,"Another dedicated AB blush lover <3 Thanks to you, I can save some money for wanting to buy too many AB blushes :P

Mochi blush: I noticed that your concept of mochi blush is really different than mine. When I look up online photos of the TCFS & Innisfree, they're cream blushes for me. My concept of mochi blushes would be A'pieu Juicy Pang Jelly and the Mac Glow Play.

Missha Vintage Robe: I have the Missha Vintage Robe as well, and I don't see any gold flakes in it. How long have you been using it?

Shimmer in blushes: How would you compare the shimmers in the Missha Camel vs the Etude House Ginger?  Which one is more skin-like to you?"
1593838883.0,2,"Hello! I know how you feel. I constantly want to check out more blushes.

Mochi blush: Mochi blushes are quite bouncy for me. If you press on them, your finger leaves a dry mark and if you apply them, the formula is almost cream-to-powder. A cream blush in my opinion would be something akin to Skinfood's Fresh Fruit Lip & Cheek Trio.

Vintage Robe: I’ve had mine for over a year now. I’ve used mine well and wonderfully so the top layer which seemed to have the small flecks of shimmer is gone. Though to be fair, I only noticed the glow in direct sunlight.

Shimmers: Definitely Etude House. With Mama's Camel Coat on the cheeks, you can definitely spot visible bits of shimmer."
1593766196.0,2,"I don't find the packaging quite bulky. In fact, I think the Canmake Glow Fleur Cheek's case to be more of a letdown due to it having a bigger area, though the dome-shaped top of EH may add like extra 3cm on top. I find that the Lovely Cookie Blushers actually have a little weight to them. Definitey not as fragile as I expected a roadshop product to be."
1593765761.0,2,"You're welcome, I was just bored one afternoon lol. 

Yes, Etude House really knows their way around powder products! They're a super approachable brand as well."

1593864622.0,1,i wish the essence drop is fragrance free...would instabuy and hoard :(
1593769625.0,1,The repair or the oil smoothing one?
1593725465.0,4,How well does the top to toe foam? Also does it leave the skin dry or hydrated post wash?
1593748416.0,3,"Have you ever try the lotion on your face? I have the cream and it is a bit heavy for summer. I wonder how would the lotion feel like on the face? If it's as good as the cream but lighter, the lotion would be better in value :P"
1593864822.0,3,"this! i tried this, zeroid, and innisfree and this is probably the most i can FEEL it on my skin cream. zeroid is also thick but seems to absorb with a bit of time, ultimately went for the innisfree tho. i live in a humid climate and the illiyoon was just too suffocating.

their gel version of this is amazing tho, super moisturizing considering the consistency."
1593769435.0,2,No idea why you are down voted but may I ask why?
1593804813.0,1,how abt putting the lotion on your face as well? Would you share your thoughts abt it? I’m really want to try it that way
1593822212.0,1,"I started using this with tret 0.025%, I love its lightweight milky texture. A little goes a long way, three drops is enough. While the absorption rate takes some times because of its consistency but when my skin drinks it up, the effects are immediate. I did not notice any tret side effects like dry flakes, purging, irriations...."
1593770180.0,1,The ceramide ato lotion. I used the cream only in winter times but the lotion all year around for my combination skin.
1593731536.0,3,It’s hydrating. It also foams pretty well.
1593748708.0,3,I’ll try it tonight.
1593865446.0,1,Are you talking about the Innisfree Green Tea Probiotics Cream? I want to try that one.
1593903683.0,1,"Agree with this. I've been using the Illiyoon cream for a few weeks and it never really seems to fully absorb and stays tacky. Weirdly, my face feels extra dry when I wake up because I think it all just rubs off on my pillow instead of sinking in? I have dry-leaning skin but this is my first summer in a super humid climate so I think I may need to try something else."
1593773587.0,2,"Because people can't handle it when someone says they didn't like their HG. Its pathetic.

It's heavy, tacky on the dry down and not that moisturizing."
1593805887.0,2,Its perfectly nice on the face as well; only thing is I don't know how it wears with makeup.
1593732537.0,2,Thanks 😊
1593865880.0,3,"yup! was on a strict fa safe routine but eventually went for it since most of the recommended ceramide products from cerave and other korean brands broke me out. didnt retrigger my fa thankfully. i emptied out my first jar last week after 2 months of daily morning and night use. I use a tiny bit in the morning since it does spread pretty well, and a thicker amount at night after tret. My skin hasnt turned into a leathery mess so I think the moisturizing power is good, feels very comfortable on the face too, no itching which i usually get from thicker creams and occlusives."
1593791559.0,2,"Agree with you on this. I'm using it right now on my body in the super dry climate I'm currently in, but the texture is not something I'd like on my face, even on my dry wintertime skin."
1593888476.0,2,"it wears beautifully in a satin-matteish finish when allowed to dry by itself, doesn’t pill under makeup! i use it as a facial moisturiser over less hydrating serums and as a hand cream :)"
1593807960.0,1,I forgot to do skincare last night but I did do it this morning and it absorbs quickly and is definitely much lighter than the cream.
1593792742.0,2,"The weird thing is, I normally love thick and emollient creams! The La Roche Posay Lipikar Balm is my HG, and that stuff is soo buttery. I also don't mind the thickness of the Zeroid Intensive Oint Cream, but there's something about the Illiyoon that makes it feel heavier and more suffocating than even the LRP and Zeroid (both of which contain massive amounts of plant butters: Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, respectively. Just trying to illustrate the thickness.)"
1593813264.0,1,I agree too! I bought the ato cream & lotion recently after a the raves but I find the lotion too light for my body compared to LRP & cerave and the cream is not as moisturising as Dr Jart ceramidin? I’ll give it sometime but I’m not loving it as much as I thought I would.
1593675598.0,7,"From top to bottom! 
all have scents! 

Romand Juicy Lasting Tints in #11 Pink Pumpkin

Romand Juicy Lasting Tints in #07 Jujube

Romand Glasting Water Tints in #02 Red Drop

Romand Glasting Water Tints in #08 Rose Stream
- glasting tints are more sheer compared to the juicy lasting ones. The glossiness appears stronger after 20-30 seconds once applied. 

Peripera Ink Tint Serum in #02 Rosy Around
- strongest pigment and tint among the tints! weight feels like the juicy lasting ones."
1593697222.0,2,Oooh the peri pera ones do look very pigmented!! I want one now hehehe
1593699560.0,1,would you say rose steam is cool toned or warmed toned? the colour is so nice ><
1593702486.0,2,neutral? but leaning slightly to warm. yes it’s my favourite out of all the tints! the perfect mlbb rose shade
1593748959.0,9,"I’ve been reading a lot recently that products containing AHA help with the pH, helping inhibit bacteria that causes body odor. So if you have an AHA serum, you could try that after a shower before using something scented like deodorant. I sometimes use CosRx Whitehead Power Liquid after showers, which was too harsh for my face, but works fine on my pits!"
1593745306.0,6,"My tips :
1. Wash twice a day
2. Use body lotion.
2. Use scentless deodorant, not AB, but exital works best for me. Not sure about J beauty, but deodorant is not common in K market. The most common on def is nivea
4. Use perfurm."
1593753940.0,3,"Are you looking for a perfume?   
If not/you're not interested in perfume, like someone else mentioned, you can just do scent layering. Basically what this means is, you use personal hygiene products that all have the same scent.   
Larger brands (a la Dove), have the same series of scents across all their products. You can find their cucumber melon scent (cool moisture) in shampoo, conditioner, body wash, deodorant and lotion. So, even if you're not using perfume, you'll have a relatively stronger scent (mainly because the product scents are the same)."
1593756903.0,2,Tonymoly has a cute little bunny perfume bar. The scent isn’t very strong but it’s easy to apply on your wrist and neck for a subtle nice scent.
1593858418.0,2,I use somebymi AHA BHA PHA 30 days miracle on my armpits and it really helps with the body odour. I read it on a thread once that AHA can help with body odour and sweating
1593748859.0,1,"use perfume body wash and apply perfume lotion after bath,both  scent are to be from the same series."
1593864556.0,1,"okay this gonna be weird but people have recommended using toners with bha since it's supposed to eliminate bacteria that causes acne...and it also happens that bacteria is the cause of odor. so any toner with bha should help( isntree, somebymi, cosrx bha etc.)


my personal favorite for it is stridex. way cheaper plus its nice to rub the cotton on my armpits and back area where i sweat a lot which causes body smell. first time i tried it i didnt smell at all the following day. so now i use stridex nightly on problems areas...takes care of body odor, prevents ingrown pit hair and texture, and takes care of the occasional bacne, super great."
1593876759.0,1,"Deodorant is usually not as strong and very rarely anti perspiring because most of us don't sweat as much as the rest of the world and also lack such a strong odor. Yes if I didn't wash for 5 days, especially in these tropics, I wouldn't exactly be smelling like peaches and fresh laundry, but on average I don't need a strong deodorant or something. Try soft stone maybe because that seems to be recommended as a strong one but it isn't that cute if you where hoping for that. As for scents I love the Biore U in the blue and white bottle - low pH! and the pink Moist Diane shampoo and treatment series. I use Kirei Kirei's peach foaming hand soap and a scent less tsubaki oil on my hair. I like Johnson's peach or cotton lotions and I don't wear perfume or body spray or deodorant or clothing spray. You can also look into laundry stuff like spray, detergent, softener, and scent enhancers but I use plain unscented."
1593880761.0,1,Have you tried persimmon soap? I’ve heard of Japanese persimmon soap used for deodorizing purposes for the “old people smell” associated with aging.
1593783972.0,4,"This 100% works and keeps me from getting ingrowns. I've used AHA (right after shaving oof), BHA (stridex pads), and currently PHA. I wash my face and pits at the same time (oil cleansing takes off deodorant residue!) so it's easy to do both with the same acid as next step."
1593770283.0,3,"I'm using Wakilala Clear Skin Essence. It's a Japanese AHA/BHA combo product for lightening the underarm area, and bonus, it's basically made deodorant redundant. I completely forgot to apply any deodorant today, and I smell like nothing at all. Bonus icing, I only have to use it 2 or 3 times a week."
1593752406.0,1,"I used this for a while after seeing Michelle's instagram. But it only worked for a short time, the smell was more annoying after I used AHA on my pits."
1593887209.0,1,What's an example fo a product that contains AHA? I'm a newb.
1593888478.0,1,Omg I need to try it. Thanks
1593785823.0,1,"Oh yes!! I somewhat recently started oil cleansing my pits on a whim (one with apricot oil that smells so nice), and I think that’s helping too! I don’t always remember to do it, but it’s a good way to use up oil cleansers that’s didn’t work out for the face."
1593788219.0,1,"Maybe some other ingredient in what you used could be feeding the odor-causing bacteria? Because the odors are off-gassing from bacteria eating sweat, basically, so if they are producing a different smell when you use the AHA, I would think they found something in that to eat."
1593821585.0,1,"No. I don't eat thing like spices, curry. For onion and garlic, i do eat them but not often. AHA only worked for a short time"
1593821913.0,1,"I meant the ingredients in the product you used. Because bacteria could eat that too, not just sweat.

If using AHA is creating a different but odd scent, then is possible that other scent is still bacteria-related."
1593608815.0,52,"Hi friends! This is my current routine, which I have been loving so far.

**Skin type**: normal leaning towards dry (being on Accutane) Used to be so SUPER oily I could fry an egg on my face. Rosacea-prone.

***Routine***

**AM**

* Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam
* Manyo Factory Bifida Complex Ampoule
* Derm’s moisturiser
* Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel SPF50
* Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50 for body

***Short reviews***

**Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm**: The only oil cleanser I have ever used and I am on my Nth bottle of this, I think I’ve been using this since 6 years ago. No frills, does the job, convenient and easy. (HG)

**Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam**: It’s a foaming cleanser but it does not dry at all, and leaves my skin really soft and plump, despite me being on Accutane (so that’s a good indication to whether this is stripping or not!) The feeling it gives is unmatchable to any other cleansers I have used. However I also want to try their Gentle Cleansing Foam, which is at a slightly lower price point. I’d still say this is an HG product for me. (HG)

**Manyo Factory Bifida Complex Ampoule**: I was using Estee Lauder’s ANR before this. This is a lot more watery and absorbs better, I would say. While I noticed a morning glow from using ANR, I wouldn’t say this Manyo product makes my face particularly glowy, but it does give a soothing effect and has a nice application feeling, and it has a great ingredient list. Maybe it takes longer for those anti-aging benefits to prove their worth. Being prone to rosacea, I love that it is a clean list compared to ANR. (WRP!)

**SK-II R.N.A. Eye Cream**: I bought this because, 4 months into Accutane + heavy air-conditioning in the summer, I find that my fine lines around the eyes are becoming more prominent, and I don’t want them to develop into wrinkles. Just the essence and derm moisturiser were not cutting it. It is also not too heavy in the way that it would stick around all night, or give me milia. I think it does the job, my fine lines around the eyes are definitely more subtle/ disappeared now. (WRP)

**Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel SPF50 Original Version**: I quite like it! Great application, serves well as a primer, alcohol-free. Although I’m rosacea-prone, I always find that my face is less red after I apply this? (This is not the tone-up brightening version). I like it more than the Purito Unscented Safe Sun, which was a bit too sticky for my liking and I felt that I had more freckles when on Purito. I still want to try a 100% mineral sunscreen though. (WRP)

**Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50**: I like it less than the Canmake, thus it is retired to become my body sunscreen. (I have 5 bottles of it left because my family bought so many of it when they went to Japan) I think it’s a bit grainy in texture too. I’m also avoiding it for my face after starting Accutance because of the alcohol in it. (WNRP)

**TO Argan Oil**: Just started this for 2 weeks. So far I like it for both my face and hair. Absorbs well I think I feel more moisturised with this added to my derm’s moisturised, particularly when I sleep in an air-conditioned room. Will see! (WRP, maybe)

**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask**: Absolutely LOVE. It just protects and (super mildly) exfoliates my lips so well. My lips gets easily dry on Accutane it does its job elegantly and beautifully. My current lips look even better (pinker and smoother) than how it was before Accutane! I also don’t think it’s overpriced, having used Aquaphor, Vaseline and Lucas Papaw to compare. I’m sticking to this. Religiously been using it every night for 6 months, I still have half a tube to go. I think I will just finish it at the 12m-after-opening mark. (HGGGGGG)"
1593627020.0,16,"Hey op, just a headsup that the banila co nourishing(yellow) is aimed for dry skin and the banila co purifying is for sensitive skin(purple)  in case you didn't know! Not saying the original you are using is wrong, just wanted to inform you if you ever want to try it out!"
1593629448.0,7,Clean it Zero is one of my favorites!!
1593621834.0,3,"I think we have similar skin types! Mine used to be very oily even in the winter and then two years ago turned very dry. Now it's just sensitive heh. I'll have to try that face wash, I like foam ones but hate the squeaky feeling some give."
1593646185.0,4,"I like the Canmake SPF so far too. It pills a bit on bare skin, otherwise I enjoy using it. It doesn't make my eyes itch"
1593630377.0,3,"I love the Laniege lip mask too!! I don’t think I’ve tried anything else that’s hydrating and soft like this. I’ve wanted to try the other scents but I’m really enjoying the berry one so far.

Does the lip mask come with a spatula?"
1593633867.0,3,"Definitely try out the sulwhasoo Cleansing Foam. It's by FAR my favorite cleanser, ever."
1593633477.0,2,Have you ever tried the Heimish All Clean Balm? I used to love the Banila co. one but find the Heimish doesn't leave the same film on my face.
1593636035.0,2,Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam! It's my HG too. Where do you buy yours? I used to buy it from Jolse but now it's gone. :( Sulwhasoo USA also doesn't have it. I heard it's been discontinued.
1593646450.0,2,I also use Banila co which takes my makeups off nicely and my acne-prone skin just feels comfortable after using it
1593651445.0,2,"clean it zero is my ultimate fav!! I have eczema and everything I used before gave me itchy skin and some even made my face swollen! But the clean it zero is the best, never had any negative results with it, tried it the first time years ago and never tried anything else ever again!"
1593655637.0,2,I have almost all of these! The lip mask is amazing.
1593642040.0,1,i don’t know why but whenever i use the Banila face cleanser i get some of it into my eyes (bcs i have to rub off my mascara too) and it leaves residue in my eye for a while until i rub my eyes and wash it out with a lot of water! has this ever happened to u
1593644228.0,1,If only i had the money to buy product but im currently jobless
1593685298.0,1,May i know how your skin changed from oily to dry? Ive really oily face but I don't see a difference even after diligently applying products like niacinamide. Thanks
1593688532.0,1,"omg finally someone who's tried the manyo factory bifida complex ampoule! i've been eyeing that for a while but apparently there's another one from the same line, the bifida *biome* complex?? it seems to have more ingredients."
1593628297.0,-3,great product ... dude
1593618777.0,14,I currently have your old skin that's super oily (also very acne-prone). Did you have any HG?
1593629457.0,4,"I use sulwhasoo gentle cleansing foam - it is my HG! I simply can’t use any other face wash/etc compared to it. I have sensitive and dry skin, and this makes my skin feel fantastic afterwards, not stripped or anything...try it out!"
1593628753.0,5,How does the argan oil smell? I have some from a different brand and it absolutely reeks.
1593634922.0,2,I love the Banila and Co oil cleanser! I find that it really cleans out any left over grime or sunscreen and does its job well
1593643297.0,3,"Not OP, but I was just wondering, have you tried the different ones and noticed a difference? I got the “Revitalising” version because it was the only one in stock at the time and I think it’s great, but my skin is dry so possibly “Nourishing” would have been an even better fit. But I get the impression that there isn’t much performance difference between them... or is there?"
1593650579.0,2,"Oohh, good to know. I knew there were other colors but never looked into it. I’ll check that out. Thanks :)"
1593622373.0,4,"Yes! My skin is sensitive too. But it’s also a picky kind of sensitive lol it does okay with some fragrances and alcohol but certain parabens give me a bit of an itch.

When I got the cleanser the lady said to squeeze and use around the length of 1/3 pinky finger, but I find even half of that works well for me."
1593670227.0,3,I bought mine in Hong Kong last summer and it did come with rubber spatula and protective pocket to keep it in :)
1593649349.0,2,"Mine actually didn’t (or maybe I missed it out while unpacking? idkk) but I bought it from a Laneige shop and is the new version. My mom got her old version elsewhere and had the spatula.

I don’t mind it too much though, I always make sure my pinky is clean before I dip in a bit!"
1593649385.0,1,Can’t wait!!
1593650039.0,1,"I actually did find the old version leaving a bit of a film on my face, and I had to use stronger second cleansers back then (a few years ago). But hlfway through the years the changed the formulation and with the new one, it hasn’t happened to me!

I haven’t tried the Heimish. Into my to-try list ;)"
1593649621.0,2,"I’m in Asia so there are several Sulwhasoo shops/counters around, and beauty supermarkets stock them too. I just went by a counter last week to look at some of the other products and Snowise was still there. I’m sorry I can’t be of any much further help..

Others are saying the Gentle Cleansing Foam is amazing too and I really want to try it next!!"
1593652100.0,1,"Haha same. I’m usually the type that wants to try different types of ingredients and formulations and such but this the the product that I never bothered/thought of changing. 

My friend gifted me a bioderma micellar water before, I tried it for 2 nights, and man I really didn’t like it. I think it just felt so weird, filmy, and maybe gave me some small spots too."
1593652239.0,1,"I love using it too! I have the purple tub though. Not sure if this is normal, but when you rub your eye makeup off with it (eyes closed), does it usually cloud your vision even when you try to rinse it off? Eventually my vision is clear again after several rinses but it’s a bit concerning to not be able to see for a bit lol."
1593659256.0,1,High 5! We have similar taste and considerations when it comes to deciding which products to go for! :))
1593649897.0,3,"Hmm...I always close my eyes when I use it around the eyes, and when I’m massaging the mascara off. It hasn’t happened to me this way."
1593661501.0,1,Yes I have the same problem with oil cleanser. I use the the I’m from fig cleansing balm. Even if my close my eyes.
1593686923.0,1,"Ahh, it’s because I’m on accutane. It’s a medication for acne and stops sebum production. I have 9 months left on my course"
1593691778.0,2,"Ooh I havent seen that! from where I get it, they don’t have it stocked haha. I think I will stick to this one for now to save the hassle."
1593621311.0,12,"I never really got to improve how oily my skin was, despite trying to hydrate it. I was also very acne-prone (genes, ugh!) so it felt like whatever product I used didn’t make a huge amazing difference. However below are some items that I always went back to for “better” skin days.

Cleanser: Banila Co Clean It Zero has been and still is my HG, and when I had oily skin, I get grits ever night when I use it to remove my make up. Before Accutane, I went through many bottles of Innisfree Bija Cleansing Gel, it was pretty good and non-stripping! I remember choosing it for its ph level (although I forgot the number).

Essence: Purito’s buffet serum (both scented and unscented) worked well for me. There is 3% niacinamide which noticeably helped my pores look cleaner and tighter. I noticed that if I didn’t use it the gunk in my pores were a lot more obvious and fill up more quickly.

Toner: Kikumasamune high moist!! Ok this was definitely HG. I actually still use it from time to time but I forgot to include it in the shelfie. It was so hydrating, I think it did help the face get oily less soon. I used it on its own on hot summer nights when I don’t have aircon on. Slightly brightening too. I use it on my body too after shower.

Spot Treatment & Mask: Generally not a fan of Body Shop products, except for their Tea Tree Oil for acne spot treatment. And their Himalayan mask was a repurchase item for me, it was refreshing."
1593670104.0,2,"Not certain if you can get this in your pharmacy but Epiduo (at night) works by 'drying' your entire face + benzyl peroxide has a slight antibacterial use. However, because of how potent it is, you may need to ease your way in when using it.

You can also get Duac (Benzyl peroxide + clindamycin - antibiotic) for morning time.

Also, anything with niacinamide is also amazing (though the effects seem to decrease after a period of time) 

As usual, sunscreen all day everyday because they essentially make your face more photosensitive too. Also check if you can use your retinoids, BHA/AHA, vitamin c products with these."
1593633639.0,3,"Does the Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Foam dispense as a foam? The bottle has one of those press top dispensers, which makes me thing that it's already a foam when it comes out. Does this mean that the contents of the bottle are more liquidy? I'm curious because I considered buying foil packet samples to try out and was wondering if the formula would be the same."
1593629075.0,3,I too have the TO argan oil.... I’m not someone who really cares about smells but this one smells like really old motor oil lol. A lot of people describe it as a rancid smell too.
1593650234.0,1,"It doesn’t smell much, almost close to nothing actually.. I’ve never used other argan oils before so I don’t know the standard. Hope it’s not an off product.

On tangent I do know how to tell the rosehip oil scent though, haha"
1593739286.0,1,You can get deodorized argan oil. Obviously it’s processed but if you like it otherwise might be an option for you.
1593675756.0,2,"Hey there, someone did a review and posted their results here a few years back. Here's the [link ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6b0z78/review_comparison_of_the_different_banila_co/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body)."

1593658239.0,1,"Oh, cool! No worries, thanks for letting me know! I'm glad you can get Snowise where you are. Gives me hope that it isn't discontinued after all. I still have half a tube of Snowise left.

I'll grab the Gentle Cleansing Foam next time since that is easily available here in the US. Hopefully it's just as nice as the Snowise!"
1593679943.0,2,"For me, only with the first or two tubs it did (4 years ago!) I don’t know if it’s the formulation change or getting familiar with the way I use it that has stopped the blurry vision.

When I use it, I directly put it on my non-wet face, massaging in circles everywhere except the eyes, and then I do the eyes last with my eyes closed. Mascaras need more time but doing it softly without tugging the lid or digging the lid open has helped! I usually then open my eyes briefly to find the tap and wash it off. No blurry vision for me in this way. Hope this is helpful..!"
1593687518.0,1,Oops sorry! Didn't notice that when you first said! Thanks for replying! :)
1593625842.0,4,The Innisfree Bija Cleansing Gel has a ph of 4-4.5 (once mixed with tap water) 😊
1593633821.0,6,"No it doesn't dispense as a foam. It's kind of like a watery gel, and it foams up when you rub your hands together."
1593629788.0,1,"Good to know, won't be trying it. I know it's supposed to have a smell of sorts. But mine has this fish/olive smell that I just can't deal with lol. Guess that's normal. I had a lovely bottle of argan back in the day that smelled a bit nutty but was nice and figured that was what it was supposed to smell like. But perhaps it was modified or something."
1593649211.0,1,From a Sulwhasoo counter! I live in Asia so it’s easy to come by
1593634552.0,3,Seconding this - it’s like a gel liquid! And foams when rubbing onto face :)
1593635843.0,1,"Good to know! Have you also tried the Snowise Cleansing foam? If yes, did you notice a difference between the two? I'm considering switching over."

They also share the clinics' recent events/offers. If you don't speak Korean at all or not well you unfortunately have to go to clinics that charge foreigners more :< Its not that much in comparison what locals would pay since you get all the service for translation and stuff. Banobagi and ID Hospital are the the biggest and most known ones among foreigners but aren't really popular among locals as I've heard (you can google some of their controversies). One clinic that some of my friends know or frequent is The Lion. I recommend to find a clinic that you like through Docfinder and then maybe contact them yourself not through Docfinder :/"

1593698083.0,19,"Double cleansing can be helpful and might not be necessary depending on many factors. The first cleanser is either micellar water, an oil cleanser, or balm cleanser. The second cleanser is water based and can be a gel, foaming or milk cleanser.

1. If you have strong makeup or sunscreen and your regular cleanser isn't cutting it, then yes, double cleansing will help remove them and keep your pores clear.
2. If you have oily skin, the first cleanser can help keep your pores clear of oil clogs.
3. Alternatively, a minority will use a first cleanser but not follow up with a second cleanser since the first cleanser removes everything cleanly (no residue). I think those who do this tends to have dry skin though."
1593697667.0,8,Not everyone double cleanses but I think it is worth trying if you wear makeup and/or sunscreen.  I double cleanse most days but if I haven't worn sunscreen I don't.  Some people use micellar water for their first cleanse instead of an oil cleanser.  The second cleanse is usually a foam/gel/milk water based wash.
1593698244.0,4,"If you use sunscreen (particularly water-proof ones) or makeup, double cleansing can be helpful on a daily basis to get a proper cleanse. On days you're not wearing makeup or heavy sunscreen, a water based cleanser alone can probably suffice. 

You are correct in that you use the oil-based cleanser first (applied onto a dry face, massaged around, add water, massage to emulsify, rinse off) and then follow up with your water based cleanser (on damp skin). 

My personal HGs (I have dry skin though) include DHC deep cleansing oil & muji sensitive skin cleansing oil. 

Some recs for oiler skin include hada labo gokujyun cleansing oil & kose softymo speedy cleansing oil"
1593710084.0,5,"Combination sensitive skin here and I love double cleansing. I don't wear make up and my sunscreen isn't waterproof, but I still feel one cleanser doesn't do the job properly. Even on  days when I stay in and don't wear sunscreen,  I sometimes double cleanse as it really unclogs my pores. 

I used to be more of a balm fan- Clean it zero (without artificial fragrance)/ Heimish/ Clinique, but now I am using an actual oil from Muji and I really like it. Want to try the Kose softymo that everyone raves about next."
1593705156.0,3,"I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin and can't double cleanse. I still oil cleanse if I'm wearing a lot of makeup but if I rub too much, I end up having red cheeks and start breaking out. So if it's just suncreen and no other makeup, I take my hydrating cleanser and just cleanse gently 2 or 3x."
1593706071.0,3,"I double cleanse everyday because I think my oil cleanser does a great job of removing whatever skincare products I have on, including sunscreen. I also massage the oil cleanser for a good 3 minutes and can see all the grime it gets off my face, including the occasional grits. It’s also wonderful for removing makeup and I prefer it to makeup removers. My second cleanser is also super gentle and helps rinse off any remaining film on my face or the conditioner that inevitably gets on my skin when I was my hair. 

I also oil cleanse in the morning, esp if I’m using heavy occlusives or tret. My skin can get dry, dehydrated easily and I never have issues with double cleansing drying me out. In fact, I think it helps to fully remove products and clean my skin well. I use Kose Softymo speedy cleansing oil and the Hada Labo gokyjun foaming cleanser."
1593709958.0,2,I double cleanse every day because I wear sunscreen every day. My skins texture and acne have improved since double cleansing and I feel like my essences/serums work better if I’m fully clean. I currently use clean it zero but DHC cleansing oil is a good one too.
1593725018.0,2,"I was skeptical of the double cleaning when I first started AB, but I do it almost ever day even if I don't wear any makeup (the days I don't I'm just lazy lol). It made a big difference in my skin. I would suggest you try it for couple of months with a fragrance free oil cleanser and see how your skin does. You can always stop if you don't like it or your skin doesn't react well. If you don't want to invest in an expensive product, you can start with plain oil like grape seed and go from there. You have to wipe it off with a gentle wash cloth or facial tissue because there is nothing to make an emulsion that will wash off. However, you can try oil cleansing with less money. If you like it, you can move on to other products."
1593712295.0,1,"If you wear makeup daily then a double cleanse makes sense, however if you only spf on a daily basis then you can get away with oil cleanse (or micellar water be sure to rinse) regularly.  Those of us who do not wear makeup can simply use a oil cleanse daily for clean results."
1593739638.0,1,"I wear sunscreen and/or light makeup and I’m simply too lazy to double cleanse. My water based cleanser works well enough that I don’t feel it necessary. And if I do feel it necessary, I just cleanse twice with my water based cleanser. I just truly dislike having a ton of product in my cabinet or standing in front of my sink for 20 minutes to “do it all.” I’ve been so much happier since I just got honest with myself about how much I really want to do (or rather don’t want to do). So do what you’re happy with and leave the rest."
1593763193.0,1,Not everyone double cleanses especially bc some people actually find that their skin gets worse from all the cleansing. I’d say 1 cleanser is enough. 2 cleansers makes sense if u wear a lot of makeup though.

My skin is fine as it is now but if it could look even better with the double cleansing then I'm all for it. 

When I have irritation on my skin I use aloe vera or innisfree green tea serum to cool it down! Maybe that could work for you?"
1593708218.0,1,"Maybe you can try using micellar water as a first cleanse? Soak the cotton pad and leave it on your face for a few seconds, then gently wipe your face in a upwards motion. My friend with sensitive skin does that and the few seconds does wonders to the ease of removal."
1593728730.0,1,"I use the banila zero to remove make up and yes, all the way! I prefer it over make up wipes! I have oily skin and get really greasy midday which is why I'm considering double cleansing. I've also heard great things about those two brands. Do you think the kids or HL is better?"

I was hesitant to double cleanse because I was worried my skin will break out or be stripped. (I'm just starting to repair my moisture barrier). But if I can improve my skin another level, I'll do it! I was thinking of purchasing the hada labo cleansing oil cos I heard great things! 

Do you also double cleanse in the morning? Or cleanse at all with either the oil, water based, or just water?"

i've since started using a quick swab of micellar water then rinsing and it feels much nicer. however if you oiliness is from dehydrated / damaged skin this may be too drying and i would just use water."

1593748389.0,1,"I generally don’t feel the need for a double cleanse in the morning as my night products do not build up like makeup/sunscreen.

1593734121.0,1,"Practical more than anything- need to replace recently and the only balm available was Clinique at an inflated cost (also don't like that it doesn't have place to keep a spatula).

1593652607.0,5,"thought id write about some of my first and oldest makeup since im stuck in quarantine


this tiny cube has been my everyday eye look for the past year. 1st color is an easy muted pink brown base, can be a stand alone color all over or a base. 2nd color is a shimmery pigmented light champage, shimmers is silver, i use it for the aegyosal or inner corner. 3rd color is a basic brown, i have monolid and dark crease color looks off on me so i just use this brown as an eyeliner or i use it on top of a gel liner to set it and make it last loooong. can also be used with no.2 shimmer to make a fake aegyosal lol. 4th color is a super pretty warm red with red and gold shimmers! i smudge it on my lower outer eye corner to make my tiny eyes look a bit longer and defined, looks super fresh.

5th color is the big red blush pan. its a neutral to cool red that scared me at first bc i thought it would be too bright but light layers of it looks like a nice pinch on the cheeks.

as for the quality, they are so so and beginner friendly since the colors all look good togther. typical korean not too pigmented colors to start with and good for those who are comfy with a few shades/doing the sameish look everyday. very travel friendly too, took it on a japan trip and it lasted decently and didnt wear off messy.

It definitely does have a gentle brightening effect, though not everyone’s PIH responds well to the same ingredients I’d say it’s definitely worth a try. It’s also a nice hydrator which can be easily layered in any routine. I went through one bottle and stopped since I didn’t want my face to be a totally different color than the rest of me, haha.

Personally, I have never seen a real difference in PIH from any Vitamin C. The Timeless product is very nice and I hear great things, so I think it’s a great Vitamin C if your skin responds well to Vitamin C. I’m on my 2nd bottle and while I think it’s a nice antioxidant to have in your routine, I don’t expect it to do any miracles as far as fading dark spots.

At the end of the day, fading PIH is mostly a waiting game, where sun protection is probably the best thing you can use to make sure it doesn’t get darker than it already is. Adding in another active can help a bit, but figuring out which one is going to work is kind of a trial and error process. It could take many months so just remember to take pictures so you can track what’s working :)"

I do live in humid tropical southeast asia so most stuff are heavy if used here.

As for result, I'm not sure if I'm seeing stuff. I am not that tan to begin with. But it's a pleasant lotion for me. I also use it on my hair when I just freshly bleach them, to give moisture back.

1593748236.0,2,"I've used both and the AIO Cream is so much better. Like A LOT better. Did I mention it's way better?

The Essence is sooo slimy and goopy, doesn't spread well, doesn't feel nice on the skin, but most importantly does nothing. It doesn't hydrate or soften or anything.

The AIO Cream absorbs so well, hydrates like crazy, plumps and softens.

I actually think the AIO Cream is more lightweight because it feels lighter on the skin due to the better absorption. The Essence just sits on the skin. I hate the Essence."
1593920770.0,1,I heard someone say if you have a dust allergy don't try snail products!
1593699414.0,1,I'll go for the essense because it's more lightweight. It absorbs well too! I'm loving holika holika good cera emusion and the Tony Moly chok chok green tea water gel cream!
1593778343.0,2,"They're all still very lightweight even for the tropics with aircon. I would consider an oil instead. For what it's worth though I've tried the halo labo light, the Benton aloe propolis. But not the kikumasamune (tried skII instead or kiku). Hado labo was the nicest and quite plumping (doesnt seal moisture in but gives you lovely hydrated plump look). I should add -- I live in the tropics with aircon :)."

1593679567.0,3,"I used to use this back in college. It will look ""wet"" at first but it does dry down properly. Pretty solid since it has a bit more substance and healing properties than the usual aloe gel in the market. Aloe and propolis can be a allergic trigger for some so dont forget to patch test if u arent sure."
1593694646.0,3,"I live in a humid tropical country too and this is my daytime moisturiser. It definitely dries down quickly and non-shiny, and doesn’t leave me oily (combo acne prone sensitive skin here).

1593679944.0,2,"I have dry skin so I'm not sure how useful my answer would be, but this product is a regular in my routine and I find it dries down really well and gives a good amount of moisture especially compared to other aloe gels. I do think it has the potential to be your last step depending on how oily you are. My skin is super sensitive and this is one of the products I reach for when I'm particularly irritated and need something soothing."
1593731483.0,2,"I have a Juicy Lasting Tint in FigFig and a Glasting Water Tint in Litchi Coral and I adore them both. The Juicy Lasting Tint sounds more like what you are looking for- it is shiny on application but the tint stays if you blot it down a bit. Glasting stays as well but it is much more glossy at first.

I have NC40 skin and they are both kind of MLBB shades with Litchi Coral being a little brighter. I have pretty pigmented lips and they still show up and have nice color payoff especially if you layer them.

Honestly I really love them because they are kind of unique in terms of texture/finish/lasting ability and the colors are beautiful. They’re not life-changing, but they just happen to be exactly what I like in a lip product so I plan on repurchasing...I’m particularly enjoying them just sitting at home with no other makeup on because they are hydrating and make me look like less of a bum LOL. They’re definitely worth the $9 I spent on them."

it has a slight fermented scent but nothing problematic imo. for context i have combo/dehydrated/sensitive skin and the rest of my routine is generally fragrance-free

i find that using a facial mist right before applying the AIO helps spread it out and absorb without any stickiness! a thicker layer of it w/o mist would function more as an occlusive imo,, i love the versatility of this product

1593607360.0,223,"As someone else commented- sunscreen. The whole concept of “eye creams” is just a marketing strategy where you get sold a very tiny and overpriced amount of moisturizer. You don’t need an eye cream.

As for wrinkle prevention, sunscreen is your best friend. Other than retinoids, there is no “magical” ingredient/ product that will prevent/ target signs of aging, so don’t buy into the bs the cosmetic industry’s trying to sell you. 💪"
1593606852.0,134,Sunscreen.
1593613639.0,36,"To touch on the ""eye creams are a marketing ploy,"" some absolutely are. There are eye creams that are obviously overpriced without a difference in ingredients or product composition. If you have a moisturizer or serum that targets your eye issues, ex dehydration making bags more prominent or dark circles mildly reduced with a brightening formula, and does not irritate YOUR eye area, then you probably don't need an eye cream.

Eye creams are generally formulated to be less irritating to the eye area since the skin is thinner and more delicate. They are also often more occlusive than a typical moisturizer. It's a good idea to compare price vs ingredients vs reviews vs your actual needs from what your routine is lacking before just jumping into getting an eye cream or believing they're all marketing ploys. No eye cream will make bags go away if you've had them you're entire life from genetics but some can minimize the concerns.

I personally use CeraVe's Intensive Repair Eye Cream bc it's very low cost and making my eye area more hydrated and plump so my dark circles are definitely minimized. There are also some vitamin C eye creams and retinol eye creams that are absolutely worth looking into since vit c and retinol can be extremely irritating ingredients. Eye creams with these two specific ingredients are typically formulated differently than just a regular moisturizer to be more gentle. Without diving into a vit c or retinol eye cream, focusing on just keeping the area very hydrated while you're young combined with using sunscreen religiously should probably be enough for your needs."
1593608342.0,20,"A normal moisturizer that you use for your whole face, sunscreen during the day (please reapply every few hours in sunlight) and retinol before bed if the skin around your eyes can handle it (light can degrade it). I use my tretinoin on my eyelids and undereyes but it can be too harsh for some people, so if you want to try a retinol, try a small amount once a week. As someone else said, a separate eye cream js just marketing to make you buy something you dont need."
1593613686.0,7,"I agree with using retinol, or an eye cream formulated with retinol. Its the only ingredient scientifically proven to help with wrinkles through speeding up skin turnover. I used to just apply my retinol cream all over my face, and use the remainder on my fingers for the under eye area. 

You could also try using tretinoin, but it may be too harsh for the eye area if you hadn't already gotten used to using it for your entire face. Hence retinol may be a good stepping stone cause it's milder but you still get the skin turnover effect.

If you're still apprehensive about retinol for your under eye area, and just want a straight up eye cream recommendation, then I would strongly suggest:

Sulwhasoo Essential Rejuvenating Eye Cream EX. 

Like the other commenters, I used to think eye creams were just a waste and you could get away with using your facial moisturiser. And I also had my share of budget friendly but disappointing eye creams. 

But I saw the light when I tried a foil sample of this. Literally within the week of using that sample, I noticed the fine lines had plumped up and were less noticeable. Still there, but definitely looked more ""ironed out"". And you might think that a foil sample wouldn't last that long, but you only need the tiniest bit with this one. The texture is pretty runny, and it feels more like an emulsion (great because my eye area is milia prone too) but it hydrated sufficiently and more than that the effects on my fine lines were just truly too good to ignore. 

So try and see if you can get your hands on some samples first! I think that's the true beauty of AB, that you can try things out before committing to the full-sized of anything.

Also I gotta credit the AB subreddit with this find, cause someone else had posted about this some time ago. I got the sample based on their recommendation and let's just say I'm really glad I did.

Edit: For reference I'm in my early 30s with pretty much normal/ slightly combo skin. 
I started noticing fine lines under my eyes as soon as I hit 30, even with using sunscreen since early 20s, and retinol in late 20s. So you may do everything right, but wrinkles are a part of life. With that said, there are products that help with the appearance/ prevention so don't give up! 💛"
1593607113.0,16,"Innisfree Orchid eye cream is great for dehydration lines and dry eye areas. I came to it after really dry itchy eyes from an Elemis serum and the Innisfree was great. I’m trying their Perfect 9 eye cream next, it has peptides and caffeine but not such great reviews. Will still try it though."
1593607309.0,10,"Look for a retinol eye cream specifically formulated for eyes, [like one of these](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/g28339109/retinol-eye-cream/). They inkey list also has a more affordable option."

1593615302.0,3,"Sunscreen as mentioned by others and retinol (vitamin A) is what you might be looking for.

You should also look into bakuchiol, this ingredient is discovered to provide similar effects to retinol but is also much more gentle and less sensitizing. 

But keep in mind that moisturising is key! Properly moisturising your skin will be the best fine line and wrinkle prevention!

I know there's no product mentioned and I don't answer your question, but I hope it will be something (:"
1593611491.0,2,"I don't think there's any. Not yet, maybe. Agree with what  other said, Sunscreen is the best for antiaging, wrinkles and dark circles prevention. If your eyes have already had those things, suncreen helps avoid further damage or worse condition. I use Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk APF 50 around, under, and upper eyes (eyelid). This has no alcohol and fragrance, (but it contains hyaluronic acid and some people are sensitive to it), so I guess it's delicate enough to use on eyes area.

Anyway, I tried using tretinoin around my eyes too (mixed with eye cream) for a month, but then I stopped. Still too drying and it made fine lines around my eyes more visible. Maybe if I was consistent enough continuing using tret for my eyes, I would eventually see results. But I was too scared. Lol.

Edit: words."
1593618807.0,2,"Retinaldehyde. It’s a precursor to retinoic acid but one step closer to it than retinol and safe to use around the eyes. I believe Avene has an eye cream with it (Retinal) and available if you’re in the US. I know it’s not AB but retinoids are the only proven anti-aging ingredients. Anything else you’re wasting your money and I would just suggest just by a gentle, fragrance free, thick moisturizer and use at night. The emollients will help smooth fine lines"

1593615886.0,1,"Ok I'll actually answer with an eye cream - I do agree with what everyone said here though, the best thing for wrinkle prevention IS tretinoin & sunscreen.

That aside, I find eye creams do make my wrinkles less apparent, helps makeup wear better, and avoids that late afternoon dry feeling I get on my under eye. Face cream alone will not prevent it (I had dry skin before tret, now it's just hopeless). And I guess my face being dry could lead to wrinkles, so I guess maybe eye cream helps a little.

Anyway! AB ones I have used at least one full size container of:

- benton eye fermentation cream - this is my current favorite. THICK formula, kind of a pain sometimes to smooth out, but I can put multiple layers on (so I can then put concealer on) & have no issues with milia. I like that it's in a squeeze tube.
- Belif eye bomb - feels very soothing & hydrating, works GREAT under makeup (I wore this on my wedding day when I'd obsessed about every detail) but can be stingy if my skin is feeling sensitive.
- Mizon snail repair eye cream. It was okay - I actually found that I prefer the mizon wrinkle night pack under my eyes during the day if I really need heavy moisture. Very thick & slimy.

Would love any suggestions if anyone else has some!! I still haven't found that perfect eye cream."

1593629450.0,1,"Only two products have made visble difference in my eye area.  
 
First was a non-AB product, the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum. I got one travel-siced bottle of this in my early 20's as a gift and after a few times puttig it on my whole face used it only on my eye area because it made such a difference. Now AB has a pretty-much-a dupe, Missha Borabit Ampoule (Also known as Long Name Ampoule on this subreddit, pertaining to the old official name Time Revolution Advanced Night Repair Serum) but sadly I haven't experienced the same effect on my undereyes though I liked the Missha one for full face. I do suspect that it was simply because there was 15 years between using these two products... But since OP is so young I think it might be worth it to at least test it in a store to see if you like it (as EL is, it is DEF scented, but I really enjoyed it back then).

The second is an AB product that I bought in recent years and have rebought and still use: SU:M SEcret Repair Concentrated Eye Cream. Now SU:M is a luxury brand and I'm not made of money so I simply bulk buy samples from Ebay. I don't think it has Very Long-Lasting effect, but if I have a formal occasion or a job interview etc. tomorrow, you bet I'll use it and look very refreshed next morning. It has similar effect as a sheet mask or gel eye mask would, just rested-looking and finest lines are temporarily gone."
1593630270.0,1,"DHC makes a coQ10 eye cream that is fantastic.  It's the perfect consistency for the eye area, most eye creams are too thin, in my opinion (which is why people think you don't need an eye cream, when you find the right one, it's magic).  It also wears well under makeup.  I've been using for 5+ years and have found nothing else that comes close!

1593724597.0,1,"The advice of using sunscreen around your eyes is good! I would add to the eye cream debate that it is going to depend on you and your skin. I have tried just using moisturizer and with my dry skin it isn't enough, mainly at night. I would suggest you try using your regular moisturizer for a couple of months and see how your skin looks and feels. If you want to try an eye cream, don't spend more than $30, or less depending on your budget. You can also try just introducing the eye cream at night only. You may not need to use it twice a day. I recommend the CeraVe hydrating eye cream or derma-e hydrating eye cream. Both are non-AB. For AB, I haven't personally tried e, but have heard great things about is the mizon snail eye cream. The main thing you want to look for is no fragrance or essential oils because it is going to be so close to your eyes and delicate skin around the eyes."
1593784694.0,1,Eye area being very sensitive needs extra care. So using a good under eye cream really helps to get away with wrinkles and fine lines. Try using derma essentia under eye cream gel it is very light and absorbs so quickly. Also it free from harsh chemicals. There are several other brands available these i have heard kiehl's under eye cream is good too havent used it personally though.
1593613342.0,1,"As a master esthetician, the best eye creams I have used is with Aveda and Arbonne. Always wear sunscreen like the others have said, but the skin around your eyes is different and does need special creams. Just a pea sized amount for both your eyes is perfect. Not too close, as the cream with move up with the heat of your skin and can cause puffiness. I always circle around my orbital bones."
1593610134.0,1,"I don't normally buy eye creams because I think eye creams are an optional luxury and not everyone needs to have an eye cream - especially if your face serums and moisturisers are already fantastic.

But I got the Klairs Fundamental Eye Awakening Gel when it was on sale - I love the feel of this one, it's a light gel but feels moisturising and it contains a good variety of antioxidants and beneficial skin ingredients. It's got a good amount of caffeine which I feel like it helps with puffiness but I don't have any conclusive evidence that it does. It also plays nicely with the mineral sunscreen I use so that's a plus."

Help?"
1593611711.0,12,"All of this!  I got heavy into skincare in my 20s, and was so sure I needed an eye cream but I'm also cheap as hell and refused to pay so much for so little product, so I just started making sure to bring my regular moisturizer up to my under eyes and lids (don't forget the lids!).  I'm creeping up on my mid 30s now and not a crinkle in sight!"
1593615447.0,5,Totally agree. Sunscreen for prevention and retinol (the #1 anti aging ingredient). You have to be very careful with retinol around the eyes area. You don’t need to use it every night because if you use too much or too often it makes the skin dry and actually gives you wrinkles. I apply a thin layer of cerave moisturizer as a buffer then retinol then moisturizer again. Skin around the eyes are very thin and delicate so make you don’t rub it but pat the products in.

1593619972.0,12,yeah i have sensitive dry eyes but overall oily skin so eye cream is necessary for me also using face cream gave me milia. Took forever to get rid of that. I use no.7 youtful eye serum and it has gotten rid of some of my fine lines.
1593626379.0,5,A few months ago I bought a moisturizer thinking it was a very well priced eye cream lol. I was considering buying the eye cream version of the moisturizer but when I compared the ingredients I realized it’s literally the exact same product just repackaged! 🤡 And after reading all these comments I’m just going to keep using the moisturizer and start wearing sunscreen even indoors haha
1593672661.0,2,"Yeah, I use an eye cream because I need a thicker moisturizer there than on the rest of my face, and I have a cheap eye cream that works for me. (Sana, it goes down to 500 yen on sale and lasts me a few months), so I've never bothered trying to find a gentle moisturizer in a bigger size that works for my eyes."
1593622536.0,4,"I'm going to second the Sulwhasoo suggestion. It 100% made a difference for me. Once I hit 28 (now early 30s) I started seeing a few eye lines, and the Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX was the product that made them go away. This one is more like a cream, not an emulsion. I buy multipacks of the foil samples and it is pretty cost effective as they last a long time."

This is my night cream and I definitely notice a difference if I run out. This plumps up the skin around my eye and makes fine lines less noticeable. This is thicker and more moisturizing than the Benton, which is why I use it at night."
1593626200.0,1,Buffer/buffering means you don’t apply the product directly on bare skin but apply a thin layer of moisturizer/serum first then apply the product.
1593607839.0,23,"I’m glad to be of help!! We need to be intelligent consumers. My advice would be to just use your moisturizer around the eyes as well (preferably fragrance-free), and apply/ reapply sunscreen during the day"
1593705936.0,1,"u/mirunamm27 

This reminds me of lip care-- you don't need a lip balm either. Don't fall for marketing strategies. Face/body moisturizers work for your lips just fine /s.  
(but really unless your lips are sensitive to your face products your face moisturizers generally can work just fine on your lips)

Eye creams generally have the highest concentration of the key points in the skincare line that it is in, which is why it's so expensive. 

Sure companies like to market them as another step to get us to buy them, but it's not a gimmick. Not everyone *needs* an eye cream, but depending on your skin condition, the other products you use, your skincare goals... you may need a separate product your your eyes whether it's marketed as an eye cream or not.

Some moisturizers can be too strong for the under eye area (ex. milia causing, redness, etc.) so it's good to remember that YMMV for face cream as eye cream."

I love sunscreen but I have skipped it for daily wear since I started WFH full-time due to covid. I don't see the point of putting it on everyday if I'm not close to a window and I'm  only outside for a quick evening walk, with a hat on."
1593610981.0,22,"Yesss, definitely!! The UVA rays don’t really care if you’re inside all day haha:)) wearing sunscreen should be a habit, just like brushing your teeth. Jusy apply it every day, rain or shine, and future you will thank you 😁"
1593614605.0,11,"What I found is that some sunscreens are simply impossible to wear around the eyes, so the only thing you can do is find one that’s comfortable enough for that area. Mineral sunscreens tend to be well tolerated around the eyes. I personally use the la roche posay invisible fluid (european version) and it’s great around my eyes as well (it’s not a mineral sunscreen, but it’s my favourite so far)"

1593625103.0,1,Can you explain what a buffer/buffering is? The term is quite new to me :)
1593617193.0,3,"Definitely not. The only issue is that some sunscreens sting really badly when worn around the eyes, so if you really enjoy that particular product for your face but is uncomfortable for the eyes, then you might need one that doesn’t sting, as it’s very important to protect the eye area as well"

1593617130.0,2,Maybe try Japanese brands for fragrance free. I’ve neen thinking anout trying a dhc one -they’re midrange but effective.
1593727455.0,1,Yeah I have seen a reduction in super fine lines and less dark circles although they aren’t going away completely. I’ve been using this tube for sooo long honestly and it just won’t get finished!! It’s been at least 5 or 6 months by now I think.
1593612461.0,1,"Yes, I've been on tret 0.025 for almost 4 months. Last month, I started to mix it with my eye cream, 3 times a week. I decided to try because I read some people had success and saw benefit from using tret for eyes. But I guess I'm not one of those people. It really dried out the skin around my eyes. Luckily, now it's getting better, with the help of suncreen and eye cream (local brand eye cream from my country). But I agree that eye cream isn't really necessary, any moisturizer free from fragrance and essential oils (and maybe alcohol) will do."
1593620679.0,1,Retinoids is the umbrella term for all derivatives. Tretinoin is retinoic acid and the active form that directly binds to the retinoid receptors on the skin. Other retinoids have to convert to retinoic acid to be effective. It goes retinol esters—>retinol—>retinaldehyde—>retinoid acid (aka tretinoin). So what I meant is that retinaldehyde is at least one step closer than retinol (which is sort of useless imo)
1593606030.0,17,I think this poster is just trying to say that the only thing that really has any ability to do some thing is retinol

1593612433.0,2,"Just sayin, Tretinoin costs me $6 a (large) tube with my prescription through my insurance. So long as you say you’re using it for acne, insurance companies often cover it.

And I second Tretinoin. I honestly think it’s the only topical thing that prevents/reduces wrinkles."
1593621454.0,2,Not rx or expensive in many countries.
1593611344.0,1,"Imagine how long it would take you to get through a tube if you were using it as eye cream. It'd be well expired before you got through it. The dose is 'a pea sized amount for the whole face'. Plus if you go by price per ml compared to eye creams it's not even pricey. Not that I'm suggesting any tret newbs to put it on their eye area (DON'T GUYS), just commenting on the price."

1593612776.0,1,Ohh!! How many times do you apply sunscreen throughout the day???
1593616308.0,1,"I’m also using 0.025 tret. Because the skin around the eyes is very thin and delicate so I buffer it with a thin layer of cerave moisturizer, then pat a thin layer of tret, waited 10 minutes then moisturizer again. I used 2 days on, 1 day off and have been fine. I will gradually move to use daily.
So I suggest to try it with a buffer and let your skin gradually adjust."

I haven't had any negative effects from it though :)"
1593690897.0,4,"Yes, they are hydrating toners. They go after actives. If you want toners that go before actives, then those are pH lowering toners. Those type of toners have very low pH in the range of 3 to 4.5 thereabouts."
1593675823.0,2,"I’ve tried the Soon Jung, yes it’s hydrating. Personally I use toners to “wipe” the skin as my first step after cleansing, so that happens before actives.

Once your skin is back to its old self, I would slowly introduce the BHA again (like once a week for maybe 2-3 weeks? Depending on how your skin feels). After that, keep your exfoliating to 1-3 times a week."
1593697901.0,6,"Take my comment with a grain of salt b/c I'm in my 20s. But as far as I can tell, the AB philosophy really does focus on prevention. This means using sunscreen regularly and avoiding prolonged sun exposure. Realistically it is difficult to treat wrinkles, particularly deeper ones, once they've already formed without something like tretinoin. 

You could try an over the counter retinol which will be less harsh than tretinoin but potentially not as effective.

Fine lines can benefit from proper hydration & moisture which can help fill in those fine lines. This includes products with lots of humectants (very popular in AB as hydration is an important aspect of many asian approaches to skin care). Products like hada labo gokujyun premium lotion, laneige cream skin refiner, etude house soon jung toner etc. for hydration & make sure you seal that in with a nice moisturizer.

AHAs (chemical exfoliant) can also be effective for fine lines due to their exfoliating and humectant properties. Something like krave beauty kale-lalu-yAHA

Facial massage is popular but it's unclear how much it will help remove wrinkles. You can look up tutorials on it. It can be done with the hands or tools like a jade roller or gua sha. Many people like to do it during their oil cleansing stage. 

Lastly, genetics influence skin aging so it could also be that you'll inherent some of that graceful aging from your grandmother :)"

Not only did it pill/form white smudges over the skincare products on my skin when I first applied it over them, it made my skin look weirdly ashy on bare skin even though I'm about an N21. Again, with makeup over it, it pilled throughout the day, making it look like I was shedding skin. I would not recommend it.

The clear one however, is quite the opposite: no pilling, very inconspicuous under makeup or over skincare products, somewhat moisturising, and it gives my skin a nice glow."
1593710728.0,1,Yes I notice that they are very similar formulations. I guess I’ll go with the clear
1593718308.0,2,I've tried both. I love the clear but didn't like the white version. It felt a little drying/chalky.
1593626243.0,12,"COSRX honey and rice overnight masks are some of my favourites! 

The honey one is great for hydration and plumping the skin and the rice is more for brightening and giving a glow. I would alternate both depending what my skin wants.

I have dry and sensitive skin and I didn’t feel irritated when using it."
1593629266.0,8,The Huxley good night one is amazing. I really notice the difference when I use it. It’s moisturizing but also in the summer my skin is significantly less oily in the morning. Magic!
1593624085.0,5,"Holika Holika honey sleep pack. There’s 3 versions and I have the canola one which is supposed to be good with acne prone skin. I have combination and I find this doesn’t clog pores but also hydrated.
Found it at Tjmaxx for $6 when I was panick buying after a nasty sunburn and soothed my face overnight.
Now I use it every night in place of a moisturizer 
It’s also packaged in a super cute glass honey jar."
1593625993.0,3,"I love the A'pieu Good Night Water Sleeping Pack. It's light and not greasy. It's supposed to have birch water, marine collagen, camomile and lavender extracts. I believe it's supposed.to be a dupe for Laneige. If you don't like fragrance, skip it though."
1593656568.0,3,Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Moisture Pack! Gel texture and lightweight... just hard to find especially these days :(
1593639807.0,2,"I really love the cosrx rice overnight mask! It's really hydrating but also quite moisturizing for my dry, dehydrated skin. It has a gel-cream consistency so it's not a pure gel, which I much prefer a gel-cream mask for my skin type rather than a pure gel. 

Another option that I find to be similar in texture is the skin&lab medicica calming cream which I use as either a morning moisturizer or I apply a thicker layer and use it as a sleeping mask. It also has a gel-cream consistency, and is really soothing & hydrating."
1593653610.0,2,I find Laneige WSP and Cosrx Honey way too light for me. I used up a tube of Cosrx Honey SP in under a month. FYI I have dry skin but I live in a humid climate so I can't always use heavy cream products. Much prefer Klairs Vit E Mask and Tiam Snail Azulene!
1593691130.0,2,"Laneige overnight sleeping mask (blue tub) is my HG. Oily skin here; it sinks in beautifully, and does not leave any tacky feeling after a while."
1593777887.0,1,A thick coating of meishoku ceracolla perfect gel is pretty good as an overnight gel mask. Only trouble is getting it to dry down pat.
1593919366.0,1,"pyunkang yul’s moisture ampoule as an occlusive. it’s meant to be used as a last step product so i feel like it counts as a mask??

i have combo-oily dehydrated sensitive skin and it’s oil-control properties when it seals in skincare are mAaaad. it keeps me from waking up a greaseball - to the point i can afford to only cleanse w water the following morning even if i’ve used heavy/cream sleeping packs underneath. so it lets me use heavier PM products that i otherwise wouldn’t use!! 

somehow it seals in thick skincare while allowing for it to be washed off with water?? not sure what magic this is but it’s HG for sure

it’s recommended for oily/combo skin - i sometimes use this in place of a moisturiser underneath sunscreen (i apply toner/serums tho!), but i have oily skinned friends who use just this and toner under sunscreen. it’s p versatile!"
1593627018.0,5,"I love the honey mask too but sadly the rice one was too heavy for me (combination sensitive skin, easily clogged pores)."
1593626630.0,1,Is [this](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-ultimate-moisturizing-honey-overnight-mask-1.html) the honey one you use? It's one of the masks I've been looking at too.
1593648645.0,1,Do you use the mask every night?
1593650726.0,1,"can attest to the rice mask being brightening. it broke me out(guess my skin didnt like something in it) so I gave the tub to my mom instead and I told her to use it at the last step of her routine every night. after 2 weeks i noticed her skin looking hella brighter!!! she even told me that her sister(my aunt) complimented and asked her what she was using lol. however, i couldnt repurchase it for her during the quarantine and after 3 weeks without it we both noticed that the glow started fading :("
1593631574.0,2,"Ahhh I love rose scents, which apparently this one has. Am nervous about fragrance for a product that's supposed to be on awhile, but I'm adding it to the list. Are you typically oily?"
1593643447.0,1,I love this too! It’s hot where I live and sometimes I don’t sleep with AC. This mask was a nice way of ending my PM skincare^^ :)
1593631692.0,3,I had the blueberry version and it was fab. I found it in the food section of TK Maxx! Also oily skin here.
1593625148.0,1,"Thanks! I was also looking at another honey mask (Cosrx), so I'll dig into both while I'm looking around. I like the look of the canola one... on first glance, the acerola looks like it has too much vitamin-C in it to play well with some spots I'm trying to repair after a vit C overdose. 😬"
1593626847.0,1,"I'm ok with a liiiittle fragrance, but my skin is prone to reacting when there's a lot. I love the effects of the Nature Republic watery gel, but that's the tipping point for me. Bummer, because I like A'pieu's cosmetics a lot."
1593656467.0,1,"Thanks, this is helpful! I’m oily but have some dehydrated spots and live in a humid climate. I like some of the Klairs stuff I’ve tried, so I’ll look into these too."
1593628869.0,2,The link doesn’t work for me D: but i got mine as a set of samples. I think the actual product packaging is in a big tube.
1593647017.0,6,"I don’t find the scent to be especially rosey, but it does have a nice, light smell. My skin is dry in winter and a bit oily in summer. I use it any time of year."
1593627137.0,3,The cosrx mask is great but doesn’t contain any actual honey. Just propolis
1593658297.0,1,"The Klairs Vit E Mask has a pudding like texture, I use it in place of my moisturizer and sleeping mask. It might look heavy due to its solid-ish texture but it's not too emollient."
1593821659.0,1,"I just bought a 15 mL of the Klairs mask for $3.. iHerb had it in their Try It! section..a dermatologist I watch said it makes a visible difference by the morning. Just wondering how true that is.

And omg I had no idea there was a Tiam snail sleeping mask!! I just looked it up and I cannot believe I didn't know about it!!! Capric/caprylic triglycerides, sunflower oil, Betaine, panthenol ..I'm drooling. Thank you so much!!!"
1593863639.0,1,"I was also intrigued by that claim, but I haven't noticed any significant / visible brightening. But I don't mind since I already use a lot of brightening skincare (ferments, Niacinamide, AHA and vitamin C).


Hehe I feel Tiam is kinda under-exposed in the community! Love the texture ☺"
1593636004.0,20,I’m not an expert but you can probably pick ones that look more natural?
1593636485.0,6,"i’ve heard applying underneath your lashes disguises the lashband more, but this method is somewhat dangerous if you are new"
1593666503.0,5,"it would be helpful to see which ones you bought, but some common things I've seen people do that makes them look off are:

-  always dry measure the length of the strip and ensure that that it is the right size. Often you will need to trim the lashes and clip it from the inner corners of you want fluttery ends or both ends if you have rounded style. I used to do makeup and I've only met one model that I didn't have to trim the lashes for. 

- purchase natural hair lashes, not plastic/synthetic ones for a more natural finish. pros for synthetic is that you can clean and reuse them and they are often cheaper but they definitely don't look the same. I really like ardell wispies and red cherry lashes. 

- curl your regular eyelashes, AND the strip. it gives you the clearance to hold the lash with tweezers and it will be out of your line of sight.

- when applying, don't just try to glue to your eyelids. drop the lash on top of your natural lashes and gently push/slide it towards the lid. do this with your eye slightly open, NOT closed so the adhering strip is going to match and not change the orientation of the lash when you open your eyes.

- when you are learning use white (not black glue). it applies white, wait 5 mins or so until it's almost clear and then apply. until you get a hang of the timing I wouldn't use black glue cuz it's harder to tell. 


hope this helps."
1593637909.0,4,"I don't wear false lashes often, but when I do I only wear them under my lashline, not over. If I put them on top the lashband is visible and it just looks messy and weird, but applied under they look way more natural. I always cut the lashes in two pieces and wear them as outer lashes, because they apply easier and look natural."
1593637765.0,3,Miche bloomin make some very natural lashes. Pure sweet and pure nude for example https://www.yesstyle.com/en/miche-bloomin-eyelash-pure-line-1-pair-3-types/info.html/pid.1074097304##productAnchor
1593647238.0,2,"Run a spoolie through the lashes (horizontally, as in against the direction of the lashes) a bunch of times to make them less “perfect” and plastic looking and more roughed up and natural. You have to be pretty rough with the spoolie to get this to work, but it can turn cheap lashes into looking like super natural, expensive mink lashes!"
1593653529.0,2,"My eyes can't handle a lot of falsies (the full volume kind; stacked; aka glam style) and this has been confirmed by two MUAs from different countries (different makeup style) lol.


Look into Korean and Japanese falsies, these are very natural and light even for me."
1593673038.0,2,"I find that almost all but the most natural of “western” lashes completely overwhelm my eye (including stuff that’s marketed as natural). Part of this may be my eye shape (also Asian), as well as dramatic false lashes not working well with my facial features even if I’m going for a more dramatic makeup look. For a more natural look though, I would def recommend checking out Korean or Japanese lashes. You do have to watch out for ones that are meant for cosplay or dramatic looks, which are often identifiable with large clumps of long lashes (for example, Diamond brand and others that look like that). 

Miche Bloomin’ in particular has ones that are very natural for me and was my go-to brand when I wore false lashes! They have some that are super natural (basically how mascara looks on people with nicer natural lashes) and some that are more noticeably falsies but still not as overwhelming."
1593636491.0,4,"Get the flared ardell wispies. Then cut the inner part to fit your eyes.  Wrap around your finger into a U-shape so it curves to your eyes.  Apply glue to lash strip then b4 putting glue brush back in bottle dot glue to inner and outer eye touching the lash line. Apply lash using lash tweezer that holds entire lash. (Plastic 2"" inch tweezers from eBay .99)  Press down inner & outer lash down then push down skin over the lash seam to make it look more natural. Use your finger to kind of curl lash up."
1593652902.0,1,My eye shape makes lashes look overly dramatic and fake at times too. I only wear falsies when I have matching heavy eye makeup too and it matches better. If I go for Korean style light makeup I only wear the individual pieces where you put a few at the corners.
1593661167.0,1,"I hate falsies. Your best bet is to go to a lash stylist who can put individual ones on and you can choose a natural look. I got it done for a wedding and LOVED it bc it fit my natural simple look perfectly, and added some curl and fullness. I can’t get any drugstore brand to work for me, be it glue or magnetic. Too fake looking and not worth the effort."
1593670591.0,1,"honestly i thought i looked crazy when i first wore falsies, but i think its because im not used to seeing myself with more than mascara. I dont have any advice but maybe you dont look as crazy as you think you do lol"
1593677492.0,1,"Honestly same for me too, I saw a AB makeup tutorial and when she said her false eyelashes were ""natural,"" I was very excited to purchase them. But when I did they looked so bad on me haha. But I think the main problem was the eyelash length is super long.. I'm not sure if it's AB but look at Doe Lashes!"
1593637467.0,10,"^^^^^ part of it is probably the style, lots of fake lashes are very understated for daily use. part of it is you’re just not used to it. trust me those folks eyes look amazing on YouTube and super extra in person too though."
1593638886.0,3,"I chose the “natural” ones and it still looks really obvious and unnatural. My eyes are like almond shaped and I’m Asian, perhaps it’s natural for others?"
1593636253.0,3,"^^^ yes go for the natural ones and get used to wearing them until you get comfortable with it on. Over time, you’ll transition to more dramatic ones if thats the style you’re going for. Ultimately, just lots of practice!"
1593639568.0,3,"I do the same! I do this only for  lashes with an invisible band, so not the thick ones. This way, they’re easier to apply and don’t weigh down your eyes"
1593638779.0,1,Can you do this with any type of lash? I’ve seen the small individual ones before
1593649108.0,6,"I don't have the same eye shape as you, so I can't comment on that, but Dolly Wink has a lot of more natural lashes that you could try!"
1593662034.0,5,"I blame the brand, not you. Some of them will just slap that label on and their standards won't match everyone's (for instance I see people push the ardell demi whispies all the time and they're ridiculous on me). 

A while ago I had a pair of diamond lashes on. One of them fell off and a male friend said he could hardly tell the difference lol."
1593641073.0,3,You can try Ardell’s natural lashes if that’s available to you. Some people also use individual lashes so you can control it more
1593696591.0,1,I works with full lashes as well as individual ones. If they're really thick it might not look as natural though.

1593665053.0,2,I don't have KP but maybe you could try a product formulated with both AHA and BHA like the krave kale-lalu-yAHA or the cosrx AHA/BHA toner to get the best of both worlds
1593665499.0,2,The rovectin clean lha ampoule is the only thing that helps with texture without drying my skin out and exacerbating my kp.
1593679373.0,2,Tret helps for the ones on my cheeks but you have to supplement it with good hydrating and moisturizing products or else kp will get more obvious since skin's getting dried out. BHA and AHA freaks my skin out for some reason so I ended up with tret which my skin likes better for some reason.
1593771486.0,2,I didn’t realise I had KP on my face. I thought I had freckles that were raised lol. I used Eucerin Dry Skin Intensive. It’s got 10% urea so I can’t use it every night but I definitely noticed the bumps becoming less prominent.
1593665561.0,1,"Coincidentally just yesterday I was trying to figure out what toner is really for and it's still a little hard for me to wrap my head around...I don't want to pressure you to provide a full blown explanation for me but what would the Cosrx AHA/BHA toner do? Or what benefits come from it? It's hard for me to wrap my head around the concept of toners because I guess my mind defaults to cleanser and moisturizers being such important products  that could help my KP that toner is still a question mark to me.

But nevertheless I was just looking at Cosrx AHA/BHA toner and even though I'm still learning what each product/term entails, I'm already excited so thank you!"
1593666011.0,3,"Toners can do different things. I typically like to think of two broad categories when it comes to toners: exfoliating toners and hydrating toners.

Exfoliating toners (like the cosrx and krave ones I mentioned) contain exfoliating ingredients - typically BHAs (salicylic acid, betaine salicylate), AHAs (glycolic, lactic, mandelic acid) and/or PHAs (gluconolactone, lactobionic acid). Exfoliating will help exfoliate the skin (i.e. remove dead skin cells - AHAs are water soluble and work on the surface while BHAs are oil soluble and can penetrate the pore). I believe it's AHA that's particularly good for KP (although double check that lol)

Hydrating toners typically don't contain any actives and their primary function is to hydrate the skin (contain humectants like glycerin & hyaluronic acid to attract & hold water to the skin). 

Historically toners were used to restore the skin's pH since cleansers used to be quite alkaline and the skin is naturally mildly acidic. However, most cleansers nowadays are pH balanced so you don't really need toners for that function anymore.

Edit to add: there are also AHA and BHA cleansers out there including murad AHA/BHA cleanser and holifrog shasta AHA refining wash"

Hello, I am desperate. I’ve been using Moist Diane conditioners for over a year and just tried the Ryo shampoo and conditioner and I think my scalp is becoming sensitized to all the alcohol in both. I am also extremely sensitive to scents and even fragrances that don’t initially bother me I seem to grow sensitized to over time to the point where I become nauseous and get headaches from the scents. 

I have thick, dry asian hair and need recommendations for fragrance free or at least mildly fragranced shampoos and conditioners, ideally without silicones, parabens, and sulfates. Most American drugstore shampoos and conditioners leave a gross film in my hair, give me bacne, or make me sick form the scent, even when I rinse extremely well."
1593640559.0,4,"Hey all! So I am looking at Korean/Japanese makeup products, and I am trying to find a foundation that might work really well with my dry, sensitive skin. Maybe you can pose me some recommendations?

**Here is the scoop:**

I have dry, sensitive skin.

I like formulas that do not have *drying* alcohols or any kind of fragrance (I have noticed it aggravates my sensitivity).

I like a good range of colors for fair-light complexions, and I prefer medium coverage. Full is fine, but NOT light.

I like something moisturizing and rather emollient, with a rather dewy finish (I prefer not to use setting products, alongside that). I do have COVERFX's Dewy Finish spray if needed, though.

I would prefer something that costs $30 or less for one bottle.

**OK, let's see what you guys have in mind!**

By the way, if it helps, two of my favorite foundations from the West are Physician's Formula The Healthy Foundation (sadly discontinued) and REVLON Colorstay."

I also have VERY prominent sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin that I am probably the most self-conscious about.

I struggle with maintaining routines, so I am wanting to start off with a very simple routine (4 steps) and hopefully over the upcoming months incorporate additional items. I don't wear make-up very frequently (maybe 2-3 times a month), so I have decided against getting a first cleanser for now.

I've also had a good experience with any of their products and I have really sensitive skin. For my combo-oily skin I love their Birch Juice cream, it's moisturizing and balances my skin but not greasy. If your skin is drier, you might want to check out their Soybean cream which is richer."

1593592733.0,7,"Took around 2 weeks for me. It helps a lot, though. I use cosrx bha as well. If you do one in the morning and one at night you’ll definitely get rid of those surface breakouts that appear out of nowhere."
1593600420.0,2,"Tried it and I started out every once a week first before I went for between 2-3 days in interval. 

Acids are strong on your skin and should be used sparingly until you've adjusted to it. Also, you should be waiting for it to seep on your skin first for around 20-30 minutes before you apply your next routine so that it has been properly absorbed."
1593584408.0,3, DHC Sunshine Vitamin Rich Serum would be good. But you already have a vitamin serum in your AM routine. Maybe DEMAR3 at night? I've used Alpe Di before and I can see it would work well for dry skin.

1593649738.0,1,"Low pH cleansers are the way to go, and the one that set me on this path was the **COSRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser**. If you don't mind a pricier more luxurious option, **Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Foam** is also lovely.

If you wanted one other product to cover most of your skincare needs, I'd recommend the **Sulwhasoo Overnight vitalizing Mask**. It's basically an amped up moisturizer that can be used in all seasons, and best of all evens out your skin tone after one use. If I could only have one skincare product besides cleanser and sunscreen, this would be it. 

Pro tip: you can usually get a better deal for luxury products on Lotte's online duty free store. Basically you purchase the item online, and pick it up at the airport after you go through customs. Also saves your husband the effort of running around looking for these products!"

1593648586.0,1,"I tried both ways and honestly there wasn't much of a difference. It really depends on how heavy your moisturizer and oil is. 

That said, I recommend mixing the oil together with your moisturizer on your palms, then applying. This gave me velvety skin, even though the same 2 products in separate layers felt a little too thick/greasy at times. It's also a really good way to amp up any moisturizer that isn't rich enough."
1593623460.0,2,I personally like sleeping packs because of their gel like consistency but they’re also super hydrating. I used Holika Holika honey sleeping pack
1593636844.0,2,IUNIK centella calming gel cream is said to be good for oily skin. It’s a light moisturiser though so I’m not sure if that’s something your looking for as PM moisturiser. Also i think it’s safe for sensitive skin according to skincarisma checks

Apparently it's more of a concealer/coverup product?

Anyway, it has an SPF of 30 and while it wasn't what I was expecting, I still like it! It has a very light, thin consistency and it's meant for oily or combination skin and it did keep my forehead from getting overly shiny. It also looked very natural on me and wasn't streaky or anything.

So I don't know how that one compares to others, but it seems like a nice and reasonably priced product!

Edited to add: There are two other products in that line as well - there is also a ""moist"" one and a ""glow"" one and the names are probably self-expanatory. I got the matte one because I'm an oily mess and I need all the help I can get."
1593729877.0,1,"That TO product is something I use every day as well in combination with HL premium, but it can be a little tricky to apply.

That way everything sinks in without any issue :)"
1593923005.0,1,"imo it rly depends on your skin / the order you use it in is more an issue of comfort/absorbency than product efficacy!

i use snail mucin as a p neutral ‘carrier’ bc it isn’t pH sensitive (as far as i know of) and works well with / to buffer most actives

my sister uses the cosrx before her TO niacinamide bc she feels that TO is a lil sticky in finish compared to the cosrx. i don’t see a problem in doing the reverse tho!"
1593597359.0,2,"What are the concerns and what products are you using? 

Actives should be used close to your skin, as products applied beforehand will act as a buffer. Depends on the active you're using, you can still have a good enough result while applying it on top of others. 

Also, some actives shouldn't be used in the AM, or have an effect only when it's on the skin, but not long term."

Turns out I have a foam sensitivity, which is why the cetaphil one didn’t break me out! I ended up using the Acwell pH-Balancing Bubble-Free Cleanser and loving it! Super gentle like cetaphil but you get a much deeper cleanse."

1593644419.0,1,"I personally really like Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish. It's a little bottle, but it's reasonably priced and a little goes a long way. Plus it's not greasy! Not quite mattifying, but not oily either. I'm looking to try a new sunscreen for the heck of it, but the one I mentioned is my go-to. It's about $10 give or take everywher I've seen it (Amazon, eBay, YesStyle)."

1593652850.0,1,Retin-A or Differin. You can start with differin first as it’s not as irritating. It’ll take at least 6 months to work

1593742016.0,1,"Hada lobo Gomujyun premium hyaluronic acid lotion is my go to. It’s not super fancy, but it does exactly what I need it to-which is moisturize my face and not make me break out like most things. It’s not very expensive and available on Amazon if you’re interested in trying."
1593647092.0,1,The serum itself is in the Allure box for this month if you want to subscribe through Amazon! Not sure if they go to Canada though.
1593651969.0,1,"The SA line by CeraVe is fantastic. I use it on my arms and it’s helped a lot. There’s a lotion and cream but I think the lotion would work better for your oily skin. The product has 3% SA to aid as a keratolitic. If you live in the states pick up some Adapalene (brand name Differin). It’s an active retinoic acid but you’ll need to only use this product at night with a very simple routine. Start by cleansing then moisturizing your face (not with the SA), let it dry completely, and apply a pea sized amount of differin to your face right before bed. Start with once a week and go from there. You might experience some normal side effects but results will show in 3-6 months. Unfortunately with KP you can only help not cure"

Purito unscented centella sunblock, and their water version

Klairs soft airy UV essence

THANN oil free sunblock

Paulas choice sunblock depending on your skin type

I think none contains alcohol, and leave white cast on skin. Do correct me if Im wrong! :)"
1593732999.0,1,"Just want to point out that its more common to have sunscreens with a Tinosorb filter, only include one of them (S is the chemical version, M the physical version). 
In addition, as Tinosorb M is a physical/inorganic sunscreen filter it will most definitely leave a white cast. So you might be better off rethinking this particular set of requirements and seeing which is a priority."
1593690335.0,1,"Retinol and vitamin C are good actives you can look into. Depending on your budget, melano cc is a good option (it has really mixed reviews so YMMV). Both ingredients target scarring and hyperpigmentation. I suggest you start off with a vitamin C, and after around 2 weeks, you can incorporate retinol into your routine.

Vitamin C at night, once every two days first. Then maybe every night after the first week!

When you start on retinol, shift your Vitamin C to the day and retinol once every 3 days.

Vitamin C options: melano CC, goodal green tangerine, paulas choice c15 booster (this is deinitely the strongest and pricest), purito vit c serum

Retinol: tbh I personally just started on this myself, and Im using Paulas Choice retinol with bakuchiol one (supposedly more gentler than their 1% retinol). I think theres a Neutrogena night cream with retinol too? Im sure if you look for retinol recommendations, you can find some here! 

Consider adding niacinamide to the routine. The ordinary has very affordable serum as an option, and good moelcules niacinamide toner is highly recommended too. 

Last point, cosrx blackhead power liquid seems to have very high YMMV amongst people, so perhaps a AHA and BHA toner is a better option. Some By Mi AHA BHA PHA is good and affordable!

paulas choice vitamin C is my HG, and La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo+ is a good spot treatment (contains benzoyl peroxide if im not wrong) , but please do not mix this with actives! 

TLDR
AM: AHA BHA toner (once every 2 days)/ hydrating toner on days with Vit C, serum, moisturizer, sunblock (very important!) 
PM: double cleanse! (very important), toner, serum, retinol, moisturizer

PLEASE apply sunblock diligently as vitamin c and retinol makes the skin extra sensitive to the uv, and is very damaging to the skin and worsens hyperpigmentation (perhaps this the root reason for his skin problem)"
1593707932.0,1,It's not mentioned in your post but a good moisturizer is a must if he has dry skin (in my opinion). I also have dry/combination skin and cosrx snail mucin essence was definitely not enough to moisturize my skin!

1593688351.0,2,"Hello! If I did not interpret wrongly, you currently do not have a skin care routine and is looking around and see what fits, am I right? Depending on your age and country, Ill have to say the essence alone is definitely not enough as a moisturizer, esp with a dehydrated skin. Do start out with a toner (not that important), essence/serum (if you wish to target any problem), moisturizer, and end off with a sunblock in the am. 

Toners: any hydrating toner will do

Essence/serum: your snail essence is good here

Moisturizer: you may wish to find a gel or lighter moisturizer for the day and a heavier one for evening (targets your dehydrated skin)

Sunblock: klairs soft airy sunblock or Purito unscented centella one are good options, with the latter being on the more dewy side. For a slightly more 'oily' sunblock, Biore is a good option.

To address acne issue, you can use cleansers/toners/mask with AHA BHA and/or PHA. Not sure about cleansers but some good toners and wash off masks are Some By Mi AHA BHA PHA toner, The Ordinary glycolic toner, The Ordinary 10% AHA wash off mask (last rec is pretty heavy duty so do a patch test! actually do one for all in this category)

Paulas choice website shows a routine with various of their products put together to tackle different skin problems, and their BHA is a cults favourite. You can make reference to their products and mix and match. I personally recommends PC as a brand, but it is definitely on a more pricey side!"

it’s probably not hydrating enough for your dry skin though, so you could top it up with iunik’s beta glucan serum! it’s a magical combination - my skin visibly plumps immediately upon application of the beta glucan :)"
1593923938.0,2,"i have a similar skin type!

i love the biore for sebum control (i’m not sensitive to alcohol in skincare) but i can see how it could be drying without proper moisturising beneath. i prefer suncut’s super waterproof UV gel on drier days (in a 100ml bottle so i’m super chill w applying liberally), but love the biore for oilier days outdoors as well. i live in singapore so it’s hot/humid all freakin year welp

i’ve tried that cleanser and it’s drying/stripping as hell, wouldn’t even use it as handwash. i recommend cosrx’s low pH good morning cleanser for end-of-day cleansing (for budget reasons, bc i don’t believe in spending on cleansers that spend a minute on your face max. i don’t usually use a cleanser in the AM)

a more budget-friendly/finish-friendly alternative for the cosrx ceramide cream is illiyoon’s ceramide cream! i’ve heard the cosrx can be sorta heavy. the illiyoon is mad useful on days i don’t have time for more than 1 serum - so it might be good for your simple routine! it’s a workhorse moisturiser w a clean formula, dries down to a satin-matte finish n great for balancing sebum production. if comes in a huge 200ml tube or a 500ml tub and works fantastic as a hand/body cream too

hope this helps :)"

However, I eventually just decided it’s not something I need...my moisture barrier is just fine, even though looking at the number of people that seem to self-diagnose themselves with a compromised moisture barrier I was irrationally worried about it. I still have it in the back of my mind, but I wouldn’t actually purchase it unless I thought I had a compromised barrier. LG isn’t something I would want to incorporate for any other reason- I don’t think it’s something that I would use as a stand-alone moisturizer anyway. Just my two cents. I’m sure it works beautifully...I just don’t have the issues it would be treating!"

I wouldn’t say it’s a good hydrator, but it’s a decent moisturizer. My main use for it is to nourish my skin, so I I rely on other products for hydration and moisturization. 

Since you’re on the fence about it, I would say it’d *probably* help, but if you’re skin is healing on the right track without it, why throw it off?"

Just kidding lol but not gonna lie, a part of me thinks it'll just be an impulse buy as I can't justify spending that much for a single product rn. My current routine is fine and working, so why do I need to buy more products, right? I'll probably think about trying it once my current products ran out. 

Maybe I'm just worrying too much about my moisture barrier too. I'm currently on my 8th week of tret and my skin is actually not that bad compared to my skin before tret. My purging already stopped and only problem I have is some flaking around my mouth and nose. Also, it's the clearest and smoothest skin I have so far after struggling with acne, bumps, and other skin texture issues for years. I should be careful in trying new products so I won't lose the progress haha. So anyway, thanks again for your comment! I really appreciate it :)"

1593599700.0,2,"If you’re starting out I’d definitely take it slow. I agree with their advice. It also depends on the formulation. You can find vit c from 2% to 21%, BHA from 1% up... in my case daily exfoliation works better because my breakouts/inflamation are on the surface level. What helps a lot is having a bit of weekly plan. You just put up a post-it with something like: monday vit c, tuesday bha, wednesday no actives... and so on. Stick to it and adjust accordingly. One step at a time is always best 😊"
1593605233.0,2,How long have you been using the AHA? I started with once a week for a month n increase to 2 to 3 times a week after that. Got result after about a month. And I only do BHA once a week because I have dry skin.
1593609034.0,2,"It really depends on the toner you're using - if you're using astringent toners best if you do it before the acids you use. Some people also use AHA as a toner itself so it will depend as well on your own preference. 

My guide is always that you use first the low pH products before you put on the higher ones."
1593736502.0,1,"No worries! I'm not usually into luxury brands, but Sulwhasoo is really something different. Almost every product I've tried from it works so well, much to the detriment of my wallet. But if I think about all the other cheaper products I've bought to find one that works AND is a nice relaxing experience while applying, then it's definitely worth it. 

So if you don't have time/ effort to experiment on products, Sulwhasoo is definitely my shortcut recommendation. 

If you need more convincing, check out fiftyshadesofsnail's blog. She has semi-mature skin and is a big fan of Sulwhasoo. Also try googling Sulwhasoo Reddit for other users' opinions. (Be warned though, you might just feel like buying everything aka what I did 🤣)"
1593599402.0,3,I understand! I’m a skincare and makeup junkie too. However I’ve learned (the hard way lol) that my skin handles it better if I slowly introduce products one at a time. Have you tried the [7 skin method](https://youtu.be/gw_8n6eSSg4)? It helped me reduce texture and inflamation big time.
1593601158.0,5,I'd go every 2 hours (if you're sweating a lot then 1.5ish) and also after everyone you get out of the water.
1593601104.0,2,"I can't see pH mentioned for the acid serum and cream, only ppm. The percentage is very low and if the pH of the toner is nay indication for the cream and serum, it's quite high. I can't imagine then being very good at exfoliation so they would probably be alright for the AM. The snail serum looks amazing, it has a lot of different oils (so be mindful if oil breaks you out- it might be because of this product) but it has a lot of extracts and ingredients that are good for the skin (afaik). 

You might want to try vit c for dark scars, but only after sticking to this routine for 3-6 months, to make sure the ingredients don't break you out. Obviously sunscreen bc of dark spots! 

You can seriously benefit from reading sca sidebar, it has good basic information and you can easily Google specific concerns."

1593734209.0,1,"Excuse me for butting in, but there is no scientific evidence showing collagen supplements work. You'd be better off spending money on proper products that work for your skin, and just eating a proper diet. 

If you have dehydrated skin, start by incorporating a hydrating toner. Ones with glycerin and hyaluronic acid usually work for most people, and Hada Labo is a reasonably priced brand to start with. Do some research on reviews to see which one is suitable for you. 

I would also start using a sunscreen as UV damage can destroy the collagen in your skin and reduce elasticity. I recommend Japanese sunscreens as they have the latest UV filters, don't cost a lot and apply nicely most of the time. Skin Aqua and Nivea Sun are some common brands, again do some research to see which you would prefer."

-PURITO pure vitamin C serum (current) for brightening and anti aging. Its good and cheap

-Klairs Freshly juiced vitamin drop. Good serum for overall improvement and sensitive skin. Better used on normal to oily skin though

-Laneige Brightdew serum. Absolute fantastic for improving skin tone and discoloration. I used it for a few years then stopped when my face is good enough to try other serums. Its also on the expensive side $55

Edit: if your skin is already well-behaved, you dont really need a serum. I think toner, essence,  emulsion, and creams are all mild and good for overall improvement and maintenance of skin"

1593797982.0,1,Yesss I loveee the pyunkang yul essence toner !!
1593622368.0,2,"I'm not sure what they mean by lighter, but the cosrx AHA is glycolic acid which is the smallest molecular size AHA, and some people can't tolerate it. It very much  depends on a person. It's good that you are starting slow (once a week). I used to got stinging when I first use it but not anymore.

U can definitely use BHA and AHA together alternately (at night). You can do AHA on weekends and BHA midweek. Once you know your skin can tolerate both products, u can alternate AHA and BHA every two days. Since you are oily, you can also use BHA twice a week and AHA once a week only. There's no right or wrong, it depends on your skin. Try to experiment and see how your skin respond. For me, when I see a lot of blackheads n clogged pores, I tend to put BHA in rotation a lot more than AHA. Otherwise I prefer AHA.

But my advice is try one product at a time first, start slow and increase frequency once your skin can tolerate it. See how your skin respond to those products. Then you can decide which ones give you the best result. Good luck :-)"

1593625439.0,5,"I don't know how arched your brows are, but mine are slightly arched (more the tops of circles TBH) and I typically fill in slightly in the middle to achieve a slightly more ""straight"" effect. 

I occasionally remove a little hair from the tops of the ""arch"" as well, to balance out what I'm doing just below the arch with a brow pencil."
1593668258.0,1,"I’m not sure how much this can help, but I’ve always plucked to have arched brows. I decided I wanted to grow them out at like 26. I used microneedling and castor oil on a regular basis. It definitely helped (I thought they might be a lost cause since I had been plucking for almost 15 years), but it was still very clear where the old plucking started. What helped me the most was using careprost (I got it from ReliableRxPharmacy, where I get my retin a too). It was unbelievable how much it helped them grow in after only one bottle of it. Now I only use a straight razor to shape them and don’t pluck. This way I can try out different shapes, and I’m loving the straight n short brow look!"
1593676755.0,1,"I can relate haha, my eyebrows are naturally angry triangles so I have to shape them quite a bit. I'd recommend drawing out the shape you want first with an eyebrow pencil. I like to pluck below and shave above, because I generally find that the hairs at the top of the arch are thinner and I don't want to take away from the volume if that makes sense. I still think it's nicer to keep some of my natural arch shape because that's what's individual to me. Overly shaped brows can look a bit off in the context of your whole appearance."
1593705354.0,1,"My eyebrows are naturally somewhat straight, but have an arch at the bottom. I know most makeup enthusiasts will tell you to comb your eyebrow hairs up with a spoolie, but in the place where my arch tends to be highest, I actually brush down! That way the bottom looks more even (this works better if you have longer haired eyebrows). It stays in place all day, especially if you use a brow gel to keep them down. I brush the rest of my eyebrow up so it looks straighter in comparison."
1593717161.0,1,"I’m not as helpful as some other comments but I grew out my brows and plucked until they were general straighter. Like if the tail is why it’s arched, remove the tail and focus on volumizing the rest by letting them grow in. Eventually, they become easy to tell that this is your new shape. But if you go to get threaded or waxed(in a non COVID-19 situation) you should still specify to them what you want. I’ve had frustrating ladies try to shape my brows into angled brows even after I tell them NOT to do that."

1593603295.0,5,"**Good news:** Rom&nd’s limited edition shades of their zero gram lipsticks are (permanently?) part of the lineup following the packaging renewal! Meaning the pretty MLBB Sunset Edition shades are available again. 

**Bad news:** I spent the last few weeks scouring the internet for the sunset shades and found them, but including shipping for buying them all individually from different sites, it probably cost me about double the original cost of the lipsticks and two were secondhand sales. Which, up until seeing the new shade lineup today, was totally fine with me as they were limited edition products. I just wish I had known they were going to be sold again, ugh. :(

I hope that qualifies as a rant, haha. I guess to make my post more relevant, I recently opened up my **Innisfree Apple Seed Cleansing Gel** which I had stashed for a while and man it is DRYING.

I tried out some samples of the original formula and really liked it but didn't have a spot for it in my routine. I bought the full product and started testing it this week and oh.my.god. IT STINKS. 
I've never been sensitive to fragrances and never went out of my way to avoid them but this cream has a very overpowering old lady floral smell. I'm still patch testing it and I can smell it an hour later after putting it on. 
It's only been a few days so haven't seen any noticeable changes but even if this product gave me Instagram-able skin, I'd be hesitant to continue using it just because of the scent alone. I haven't tried any of the other collagen products so I can't say if they're stinky too."

1593484917.0,224,yeah they do this all the time. list the regular price as something hugely falsely inflated so they can put it on sale for a very very minuscule discount compared to the real price so they can pretend it’s a way better deal than it actually is

I was working for a Korean skincare brand up until the COVID outbreak and was responsible for our overseas channels including YS. The contact person/team at YS literally had no idea how to price our products, despite me sending them full list of our recommended retail prices. They would always set the prices either ridiculously low (when we added new products) and then I would spend weeks going back and forth with them to get them to fix the prices -- at which time they would almost always make the prices higher than what we listed. Absolute mess, each time. I can't imagine what a mess their customer service must be."
1593493798.0,60,"Yesstyle does this all the time. I remember once they had a 80 or 90% off sale and they tried to claim the original price of an Etude House lip tint was $56 😭

Also the first time I noticed that they did this was because I had taken a screenshot of a $5 Shrek lip balm because I found it funny, and later while I was browsing the site when they had a 10% off sale, the Shrek lip balm was still $5 but the “original price” was now $5.50."
1593490909.0,116,"YesStyle does this a lot unfortunately - really shady. If you’re looking into the PY essence toner but don’t want to use YesStyle, I got mine on OhLolly! It’s a reputable site for K-Beauty."
1593492249.0,25,"Recently I switched to iHerb, there are a couple other decent competitors out there too. Worth your time to surf to compare pricing first."
1593495427.0,23,"I see this happening a lot, not just on Yesstyle but generally on online shops. I also saw many physical shops have incredible high “sales” 24/7 when I was in Korea, which made it pretty likely the sale price is simply the actual price for the item, because a bunch of shops were “80-90% off on everything” the entire two weeks I was there.

That tactic is used to make people feel like they’d be missing out if they don’t buy right now. It’s always best to match the prices on other websites before buying, especially since yesstyle has big sales basically every other week and you’ll most likely get the same price again soon. These sales often end up being *slightly* better than usually anyways, but it really just by a couple of bucks, typically 10-20% off the original base price. Sometimes the price on sale is a little higher than the usual base price though, so make sure to match! I’ve seen the same being done on Jolse, even though not as often and not as obvious."
1593485393.0,75,Customers are getting taken advantage of because not everyone has the patience to search other sites for a cheaper price when they are already familiar with YesStyle / trust them and when they say products are on sale. It's a common online marketing tactic.
1593522000.0,11,"So I have a funny story: 
I ordered the Klairs sheet masks with the order, their app said $4.41 so I adjusted the total to fit the free standard shipping to $35 (no tracking code). But I got charged $3.75 per mask so my total was $33, and I ended up paying the $5 shipping. I sent them an email saying I got screenshot of the app order (I always take one before I purchase) and asked them to refund the $5. They did refund with a coupon and their reason was ""changed due to the sale promotion on (Date). Kindly note that product prices may change at any time without notice for sale items"". 
Heck it was a THURSDAY, not the usual Tuesday when they change their weekly ""sales"". 
Later I observed that sometimes the prices are lower towards the weekend.

They do this all the time. Sometimes they increase their prices during sales and promotion code days so you'll still buy them at the original price. I've purchased the PKY toner 3 times from them, twice it was $15.44, once it was $16.13. I monitor prices and wait till it hits the lowest before ordering, unless I'm running out of stuff. 

That being said, YS do have genuine sales like the Black Friday sales, I managed to buy a Klairs moisturizer with a $12 discount, even without a promo code. But most are just 'sales' with whacky names and no real benefit.  

I live in a place where most businesses don't ship to or I have to pay more for shipping (like StyleKorean) than the product price listed, having to pay no shipping cost when purchasing above $35 is kind of a blessing I guess. We don't have kbeauty stores here except for Face Shop that doesn't feature the whole collection of goods. But we do have Instagram businesses where people get stuff down (sometimes from YS) and sell it with a $5-$10 increased price tag. So I got no choice other than YS."
1593499943.0,8,Yesstyle does this with all products. Check out stylekorean or wishtrend. I’ve heard rose rose shop is good too but haven’t used it yet. I like stylekorean but has only Korean products. Wish there were more websites where I could find Japanese and/ or Korean products with decent prices and good shipping.
1593505480.0,9,"First time I used yesstyle I bought a pair of shoes that apparently was £80 reduced to £16, it look nice so I bought it and the quality was so bad. It had the cheap material smell and the packaging was just with plastic wrap. So I think they markup their prices on everything, sometimes it is better than places like eBay or amazon if you’re buying beauty products but don’t believe the clothes haha"
1593508047.0,7,"Yea, I really think they exaggerate their pricing .. much like Aliexpress so they can offer you 'this sick deal until xx date"".

I've only just made my first purchase on Yesstyle for the PMEL Mascara base, and they're the only store online that had it for a reasonable price (apprx. $30 AU). Amazon and Ebay vendors  were selling it for over $90. Unfortunately, they would only despatch it 2 weeks from purchase date, so I decided to make the long wait worth it and picked up a bunch of cosmetics and nail art bits. 

Auspost has just received shipping info, but I don't know when I'll see it...

Stick to your local KBeauty vendors if you can. I don't think they'll sell you fakes but I'd rather pay $10-$20 more knowing it's from a legit seller. Good luck xx"
1593527794.0,6,"Pyunkang Yul is my HOLY GRAIL and I always find the 200ml on Ebay (I live in the US) for around $13-$16. And lately on the app they’ve been doing $10 off $20 purchases! So it’s free shipping (takes like 2-5 days) PLUS a great deal! I don’t think YesStyle is for me unless I plan on buying like 8+ products. Check ebay, they have so much k beauty!"
1593558656.0,4,"I started shopping at YesStyle over 10 years ago, begging my dad to buy me strange hoodies with bear ears on them and other odd finds that at the time you just didn't find in the US. Back then they didn't do this trick that a lot of websites now use, I miss those days.

No instead they just had a surprisingly good price point. Clearance items would show as less. Their prices have always been really good so I don't understand why they need to zing us with that dopamine sale hit or whatever. Then again, yes I do. It's worked so well for other sites and keeps customers coming back.

It is a shame though because I'm not interested in rock bottom prices (even though they basically are!) I am at YesStyle for the same reason I was there 10 years ago. Their selection is STILL hard to find, and now they even ship free. Now whenever I see too many price slashes on products I am leery that they are using this trick. And it instantly lowers the site's value in my eyes."
1593493489.0,8,"Yea they do this.

I am so upset with the 25$ shipping fee but I understand because covid times, still, big sigh, the situation is the same for a lot of websites and on jolse shipping would cost me 40 bucks!"
1593503491.0,3,"Yeah, you shouldn't really believe their 'offers' that they say are limited. I've had items in my cart for month and they still have the 'discount' so"

1593531982.0,3,"I have gotten some incredible deals from YesStyle but I was looking at re:p products last week and they cost the same at YesStyle and Ulta (+/- $3). Of course I’m going to order from Ulta because I live in the United States so I get cheap or free shipping that is reliably fast, rewards points, and cash back from whatever they call ebates now.

Compare that with $13.99 shipping from YesStyle. Sure I get 6% off because of their discount program but it’s not worth it."
1593507834.0,4,I'm definitely not defended Yesstyle's practices but I definitely do get genuinely awesome deals on there all the time.
1593517972.0,2,"This is why I stopped using YesStyle, they do this all the time. For UK people I now use StyleVana and its so much better, the shipping is quicker too."
1593531077.0,2,"Yeah, that sounds like YS. I just keep track of price points for my HG products, so their constant changes don't skew my perception. I don't see it as any different than the ""loss leader"" nonsense that grocery stores pull."
1593536960.0,2,"They always do that, they would jack up the ""regular"" price and then give it a 80% off to make it look like a great deal.  I've seen it where their pre-discounted price changes all the time on a lot of items.  I mean they still have good deals on a lot of things, but I would take their ""80% SALE"" (etc) with a grain of salt.  

Make sure you review on all your purchased items to get 1000 style points (whatever it is called) and boost your status to the highest because you'll get additional 10% off on everything. I think it's 100 points per review."
1593515653.0,1,yes yesstyle do this.

I somehow manage to always have something wrong with my order, either I accidentally buy the wrong colour lipstick, or I decide I‘d rather not buy an item after already ordering or I had it in the wrong size.. with big Yesstyle orders I often sneak in a mistake or have general questions 🙈

I‘ve always gotten competent and helpful answers within less than a day, aswell as quick refunds. I wonder if they just didn’t want to list the items at the prices you proposed and intentionally misunderstood 🤔"
1593513625.0,11,Second OhLolly!
1593706949.0,1,"Seconding on iHerb. There’s also a coupon code “NEWFRIEND20” for 20% off for first time customers! And iHerb has other awesome things as well. 

I was extremely interested in getting this toner and when I saw the price after discount I made a huge cart with a few of the Pyunkang Yul products I wanted to try and some delicious snacks and other stuff also but then when I logged in, the coupon went away because apparently I made an order years ago and the discount doesn’t apply. But it was good that it happened that way, I need to get on a no-buy! I have all the skincare I need now. I’ll buy the Pyunkang Yul stuff when I run out of my current stuff."
1593499270.0,11,"From experience, when a K-Beauty brand sets prices for products, they take into account that it has to be on ""sale"" in order to sell.  
IE. if the production cost of a sheet mask is 500KRW, you might assume that it would sell for 3000KRW. However, the brand will list the official price at 4000KRW - because they know once the product hits shelf they will have to add a ""sale"", maybe 20%, in order to entice consumers. With the added sale, the product sells for 3200KRW - the brand still earns the 3000KRW that they wanted while the consumer thinks they made a good deal...."
1593490605.0,32,"True, for shipping to Australia I found South Korean sellers on eBay almost always cheaper than YesStyle pre COVID-19. Now shipping from the sellers is $15-30AUD for one product so YesStyle works out cheaper."

I checked out Jolse a year ago but I can't clearly remember why I took that out of the equation. I think I had to spend more to get free shipping and had a higher paid shipping rate than YS.

""agreements

These agreements are known as cartels. They are forbidden because they restrict competition. They can take many forms, and need not be officially approved by the companies involved. The most common examples of these practices are:

Price fixing

Market sharing

Agreement on customer allocation

Agreement on production limitation

Distribution agreements between suppliers and re-sellers where, for example, the price charged to customers is imposed by the supplier

All agreements and exchanges of information between you and your competitors that reduce your strategic uncertainty in the market (around your production costs, turnover, capacity, marketing plans, etc.) can be seen as anti-competitive."""

1593535985.0,9,"Suppliers to retailers within Europe can actually legally state and recommend their ‘recommended retail prices’ aka RRPs to the retailer.

Normally, RRPs are actually a good recommended pricing format, as you wouldn’t want to go too high or too below this price as it could affect how the customers see value within your brand. What would normally happen is a supplier or brand advises the RRP and then the retailer would price around that. Although they’d never usually sell an item higher than its RRP. 

What isn’t legal and goes against EU competition law, is when a supplier states that you have to price an item at a certain selling price. 

Selling price vs recommended price are very different things when you discuss these things as a supplier. 

A supplier can legally say they have a fixed RRP, but it’s illegal for them to say their selling price is fixed. The selling price is at the complete discretion of the retailer."

It's not something manufacturer like as it interferes with their interest that their brand is ""cheap"" and not worth it.as this could devaluate the brand. But this is hypocrisy.

**romand glasting water tint 03 brick river**: oddly enough, this has the same flowery soapy scent as the peripera ink airy velvet but this lingers on more as you can taste it since it’s a glossy lip :o anyway the colour is a nice orangey reddish brown that can be more intense if you apply full lips!"

I ordered from everglowcosmetics.com and they shipped with DHL and it got here super quickly. They have a markup though, with each eyeshadow being $25 when I think they retail for $20. The eyeshadows are buttery soft and apply smoothly. Flash Back and Never Land go on more pigmented and smoothly, as metallics tend to do. Mariage is a sheer champagne gold glitter. Pictured are several swipes as it doesn’t pick up heavily, which I like because glitter tends to be intense. Flash Back is a beautiful metallic taupe, which I have a bunch of but I can’t resist pretty taupes.

1593538168.0,38,"I bought it, and it's okay in the way that every single not-terrible eye cream is okay. It hydrates, it's not heavy or greasy. That's about it. 


I used it twice a day for a few weeks and wasn't blown away. No effect on fine lines or dark circles, not even temporarily. I'm personally of the opinion that if your current routine is hydrating enough, and your face cream isn't so heavy it's giving you milia, you don't need a separate eye cream.



The reason everyone's constantly on the search for an HG eye cream is because basically none of them do more than hydrate lol. If you want to address crepey skin, use one with retinol. If your undereye is puffy, try one with caffeine. Otherwise there's no miracle cream.

It's not bad, it hydrates nicely and it's light on the skin. It's also pretty cheap for the volume you get. Just have realistic expectations about what an eye cream can do for you."
1593551726.0,15,"I feel Iike the true test of a product happens when you run out and notice that your skin isn’t looking as good as it was when you were using it. I didn’t have that experience with this eye cream. Once I stopped using it I realized I didn’t miss it, and I didn’t notice a difference in the appearance of my under eye area. I didn’t feel like it did much for me, even the very basic function of moisturizing. 

My two favorite eye creams are the Etude House moistfull collagen and the Secret Key starting treatment rose eye cream. The Etude House one gives instant results. It plumps the skin right up and fills in those fine lines as soon as you apply. The Secret Key is one that falls into the you notice what it was doing for you once you stop using it category. It brightens and smooths fine lines over time. It is scented with a strong rose scent though, so could be a miss for people who are sensitive to fragrance near their eye area."

1593558690.0,2,It's not bad and didn't irritate or be too greasy. No eye creams have changed anything that whatever I use on my face doesn't do. This was the same. If an eye cream is too heavy it makes me puffier. This didn't. I liked it. It is not game-changing.
1593564290.0,2,"define ""work."" is it a moisturizer? yes. will it hide your dark circles or disappear your wrinkles? no."
1593569522.0,2,"I agree with the people in the comments. The eye cream was more of a moisturizer around the eye area and it did not irritate my eyes but in terms of dark circles and wrinkles, it didn't do much. It's not greasy either."
1593570685.0,2,It did a nice job for me. Not too heavy but not too light either.
1593592356.0,1,I really like it as i have ultra sensitive skin and eyes and it is the best cream i have found it is not greasy or oily and the moisture really lasts an alternitive would be all about eyes from clinique but it is a bit more irritaring for me
1593539443.0,4,Well said.
1593583668.0,3,"This is on point. 

I'm going to add to this that many eye creams are moisturisers with a very small amount of actives (retinoids/niacinamide/caffeine etc.) in it. It's therefore gentler for the eye area. 

If you've got a moisturiser that doesn't give you milia or irritate the skin around the eye area and the actives necessary to target your concerns on hand, you can try mixing a small amount into the moisturiser."
1593829341.0,2,Some very good points
1593595687.0,6,"Hello everyone!

Just received my [YesStyle Summer Sale haul](https://imgur.com/NqFpbgH). The Ordinary products were sold out everywhere so decided on a complete Asian skincare routine. I make online purchases every 6 months so I tend to stock up on products and that’s why this may look excessive (looking at you [r/SCACircleJerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCACircleJerk/))…

I’m 23 F, NC 30, located in a hot and humid climate dealing with bad summers. My skin type is normal (oscillating between dry and oily on bad days).

FTP - First Time Purchase

RP - Repurchase

HG - Holy Grail

From the top-right—

1. I’m From Honey Mask (FTP)
2. I’m From Mugwort Mask (FTP) - Currently don’t have any masks in my arsenal so thought I’d try out these highly raved masks. They are supposed to contain up to 5 uses each.
3. For Back Herbal Citrus soap (FTP) - Hot and humid climate is lending itself to sweat rashes. Read good reviews.
4. Purito Galacto Niacin 97 Power Essence (FTP) - First venture into Galactomyces and ferment ingredients formulated with 92% Galactomyces ferment filtrate and 5% Niacinamide. This will be replacing the TO Niacinamide.
5. Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum (Scented) (RP) - Good for use after chemical peels and acne spot treatment (Epiduo). Scented was cheaper than unscented and I’m not sensitive to fragrance.
6. Kose Softymo (Speedy) Cleansing Oil (FTP) - This will be replacing my Klairs Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil because its cheaper.
7. CP-1 Head Spa Scalp Scaler (FTP) - I’m a huge believer in scalp health. I deal with scalp acne in summers. This will be replacing the Christophe Robin Sea Salt Purifying Scrub which seemed slightly harsh.
8. Curesys Trouble Clear Microneedle Patches (FTP) - Cheaper than ZitSticka. I deal with one or two blind cystic acne which scar badly (even without picking) during my periods. Will try to gauge efficacy.

From the bottom-right—

1. Biore UV Athlizm Essence (FTP) — Would like this to replace LRP Shaka Fluide as a water-resistant and sweat-proof sunscreen. The LRP sunscreen has enough alcohol to be troublesome to me when I’m dealing with sensitive skin.
2. Rohto Melano CC Essence (RP) — Use it as a spot treatment fort PIH. Was told a repurchase is necessary to see results. I will give it another try.
3. Isntree 8% AHA Essence (FTP) — 4% lactic acid and 4% glycolic acid. To replace the out of stock TO AHA BHA peel.
4. Iunik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum (FTP) — I liked the way using a propolis mask made my skin look. This is a vanity try.
5. Tiam Vita B3 Source (FTP) — 10% Niacinamide and 2% Alpha Arbutin to kill 2 TO birds with one stone. I will be missing the zinc though.
6. Holika Holika Good Cera Emulsion (RP, HG) — Use this as a moisturizer both in the AM and PM. Keeps the skin barrier in top shape!

I will be starting with the Tiam Vita B3 serum (AM), Iunik serum (PM), the I’m From masks, the herbal soap, the scalp scaler, the cleansing oil, and the microneedle patch. Do let me know if you’d like a review of any of these products. I'll do a review post then."
1593602384.0,2,"The new Laneige Neo Matte Cushion seems to be the hottest trending summer cushion in Korean beauty youtuber world and after weeks of this, OKAY you have my attention. It’s receiving great reviews and the design is fantastic so I’m about to cave. Seriously go look at it, it’s so pretty. I’ve been looking for a website shipping to the US but friggin Gmarket how did you know I was looking for this? Gmarket never emails me but they did today, with a coupon for THIS cushion. Yeah I’m gonna cave

1593635678.0,3,Please review the Isntree 8% AHA Essence when you have a chance to use it! I'm currently using the CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid and was looking at other alternatives once I finish.
1593636709.0,1,I would love a review of the kose softymo speedy oil and melano CC treatment! Those are currently on my wishlist 😭
1593637176.0,1,I’m interested what you think of the athlizm. I just started using the Shaka fluid since my Japanese Nivea was not sweat resistant enough. I dont find the alcohol irritating but didn’t go with the athlizm because of strong fragrance (I’m not sensitive either I just didn’t want to gamble on a scent that reviews said was intense and I might not like.
1593793522.0,2,I wish I had seen this a week ago when I placed my order for a bunch of ab stuff. I went with the moonshot micro
1593669196.0,2,"For the Melano CC: I think it worked, but up to a point. I don’t need Vit C for brightening, etc but I’m trusting its ability to reduce PIH. When I raised the limited efficacy point on another subreddit, I was suggested to try it out for longer.

I like the packaging and formulation because Vit C formulations are very finicky. The packaging keeps it safe from oxidation and the product wears and sinks into the skin well.

Hope this was useful :)"
1593669223.0,1,"I’ll do a patch test soon and will update you!

Update: It does have a strong scent upon initial application but dissipates soon after. It forms something of a barrier on the skin i.e it won’t sink into the skin so it’s not very cosmetically elegant. No white cast. Will require an oil cleanser to remove.

I hope this was somewhat helpful :)"

They do take a bit longer to dry up but still very fast.  The bonus is that they also work so well as a makeup primer.  If you live in the states I suggest buying it from The Yoku Glow, love their collection, fast shipment, and free samples 🥳"

1593544385.0,4,I wish I didn't have to care about these things. Alcohol I can sometimes tolerate depending on the formula... but fragrance and essential oils will make my eyes swell up and burn even if I use it elsewhere on my face and my skin stings all day and turns beet red.

1593567259.0,1,WHAT DO  you use??

1593468060.0,26,"Please don’t buy any lash serum and save your money. If you look into the physiology of our hair  these products won’t be able to promote growth externally. 

Most of them contain biotin, castor oil and other hyped ingredients. These products will not work and can possibly cause more harm like clogged pores where the eyelashes are which can swell the eye or introducing new irritants to that area.

There is only 1 medication that is FDA approved (US) to actually grow lashes. It’s a side effect of glaucoma medication called Bimatoprost (generic) or Lumigan (brand). It’s been changed and rebranded as lash grow medication called Latisse. Once you start using it you should not stop because your lashes will fall out. (I had a pharmacology/pharmacokinetics class and we learned about glaucoma medications.)"

- castor oil : it took me a while before I started to notice a slight difference, but they eventually grow more and thicker. 
- Revitalash : worked well after 6 weeks, lashes were longer and I had a fuller look. 
- RapidLash : quicker results than Revitalash, I’ve applied that after removing my eyelash extensions and it really helped. I have used it for a 7 weeks and my lashes are definitely longer.
- Hashitomi : didn’t like it at all. Its not convenient to use, as they give thin a S-tip to apply the serum on your lashes, however most of the serum get absorbed by the q-tip so it’s a waste. Also didn’t make any difference to me. 

I found revitalash very expensive, but to be honest for the results it gave me I think I would buy it again."

1593463268.0,20,Did castor oil make a significant difference for you? I’ve been using it for multiple weeks now and I’m not sure if it’s worked a little bit or I’m imagining things?
1593464781.0,9,"Wanted to say when I was using castor oil for my eyebrows/eyelashes for a while, it realllly helped with growth!!! I need to get back into it but it's definitely worth buying"
1593482296.0,1,"Yes to castor oil! I’ve used latisse, careprost & several other prostaglandin lash serums in the past. I got good results but they all gave me dark lids, I looked tired all the time! I don’t think the side effects are worth it. And somehow, since it’s a drug, after around 2 years of using them, they stopped working for me. My lashes slowly went back to their original length & thickness.

I have now switched to castor oil (clean, healthy, cheap) & surprisingly it works for me! As someone who has used latisse before, I really had low expectation but I noticed growth after about a week! I was shocked bc with latisse, it took me 2-3 months to notice a change. I think that’s bc latisse works by extending your lash growth cycle while castor oil works by actually stimulating growth. I’ve been applying castor oil to my lashes with my fingers every night for almost a month now & my lashes are definitely noticeably longer & i’m noticing new lash growth! It’s definitely part of my routine now & I plan to keep it in my routine permanently. HG for sure.

Also, tbh I don’t think it works for everyone. It’s worth to mention that I’m southeast asian & my natural lashes are not at all short or thin. I remember one time when I was 14 I caught conjunctivitis in my left eye & I was prescribed this eyedrop & eye ointment by my gp. After about a week, the lashes on my left eye were significantly longer than the other! It was weird even my friends commented on it. Looking back, I think the moisturizing ingredients in the ointment or drops make my lashes grow. I guess my lashes are easy to grow. Castor oil is cheap! Everyone should give it a try & see if it works for you."

1593491742.0,1,"Lash serums use synthetic versions of Bimatoprost, the main ingredient in Latisse. Two popular lash serums are Lash Boost and Babe Lash and they use Isopropyl cloprostenate. They also can have worst side effects than Latisse tho since it's not FDA regulated. The use of the same wand in a tube isn't as hygienic and that's what causes the clogged pores. Lash Boost currently is in a lawsuit for increased eye infections."
1593543968.0,1,Seconding this! It totally works for me and is dirt cheap!
1593466677.0,20,"Most of these serums are meant to strengthen the lash so it won’t break or fall out as easily. We damage our lashes quite often by rubbing our eyes, curling them, etc. So oils, peptides, etc.

When you’re looking for ingredients that actually do something, you’re looking for “bimatoprost” “Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans”, things related to this. These ingredients help extend the “life cycle” of your natural hair so instead of dropping out after 4 weeks, it’ll just keep growing until it can’t anymore, and stay. It’s originally something they found out after people with glaucoma started treatments, and reported to have grown insane eyelashes. These ingredients do often give a side effect of darker eye areas (dark circles and dark eyelid), and even cause some slight tinge of yellow to the whites of your eyes."
1593465655.0,3,They’re not worth it imo because you have to keep applying it constantly because lashes fall out often like any other hair so you need to be really on it for any benefits.
1593467086.0,5,"(I live in the US) Not as a growth medication. If a company we’re to make those claims in the US it has to be tested and FDA approved. I have yet to see any claims of that from AB products being sold here through resellers like Ulta, Sephora. I personally wouldn’t invest in any of these products mentioned. 

If you buy it here in the US it’s called Latisse (Lumigan is the brand by drug company Allergan). It is an FDA regulated medication to grow lashes. You have to get a prescription by a dermatologist or your doctor. It’s original use was medication for glaucoma but the side effects were hair growth from eyelashes. The one problem is if you stop using it you will lose your eyelashes. Here’s a [Canadian Medical Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185096/) about it."
1593464051.0,1,"My guess is that, by applying a lash serum, you're strengthening your eyelashes so it won't break off as easy => Fuller lashes. Also oil helps lengthen, kinda the same idea with hair + shampoo"
1593530686.0,2,i don't know. doesn't work for me. i use it for years but my lashes are still the same short.
1593494329.0,1,Same here! Waiting for responses....
1593487113.0,1,Worked for me too and I’ve been using for an entire year now. It’s not as dramatic an effect as Latisse though. But also without the horrible eyelid darkening I had from Latisse so it’s a good trade off for me.
1593480900.0,1,"Can absolutely vouch— I already have thick Indian lashes and GrandeLash made them noticeably thicker to the point I had to stop using it (baby lashes even near my inner eye corners). 

Sephora sometimes has a sample with any purchase but you can also just order online and return if it doesn’t work for you. Someone also mentioned B vitamins and I agree that it can help over time, along with a good quality skin/hair/nails supplement (anecdotal, ymmv but it especially helped me with hair resilience/fallout)."
1593544266.0,1,"Seconding this! It’s the only lash serum that actually makes your lashes longer by extending the growth cycle by 2-4 weeks. Other products will only help by conditioning your lashes to keep them healthy and look fuller. I haven’t seen much of an improvement in volume, however. But I got so much length that the next time I went in for lash extensions my lash technician freaked out that they had gotten so long!"
1593469276.0,1,"I got it in Asian grocery store in nyc, it's a light gel that also doubles up as very light eye cream. I didnt use it enough to see an effect since I am on Avance last essence ex (which I like) and DHC lash tonic (doesn't lengthen but it makes them stronger."
1593463577.0,33,I honestly didn't see a difference but I was told by a friend that my lashes looked fake because they were so long. That was at the 3 month period so I think its helpful but will take a while for you to notice. I've been using it consistently for a year now and they are fuller and longer. Also castor oil is cheap and can be use for multiple things. I also use it in a hair mask and body scrub. Since I break out with coconut oil :(
1593463468.0,13,"100% works for me. I notice a dramatic difference when I apply it regularly before bed vs. when I skip for a few weeks. Not placebo at all. I'm sure you would see similar results with most oils, not just castor. Anything that conditions/strengthens the lashes."
1593479639.0,4,"I've never seen improvements from it, neither on my brows nor lashes. I applied it with a spoolie sample for months, and.... Nothing."
1593460302.0,4,Aw I'm jealous. I really wanted it to work bc it's so cheap
1593464367.0,1,Maybe the temperature caused it to get sticky? Heroine mascara is amazing! I read somewhere that japanese mascaras are very harsh and you're supposed to put on lash primer before the mascara. I don't have any primer but I use the etude house serum for primer and it works great
1593473182.0,1,Where are you from?
1593492006.0,1,I switched over to Latisse from Babe Lash. You can get a prescription from a primary doctor. Make sure you get the bigger size bottle. Use GoodRx for a coupon. I go to Walgreens and can get it for $65 after the coupon. It's a small bottle but will last about 2 months. I personally don't like the single use wands it comes with so I use an angled eyeliner brush and sanitize with rubbing alcohol before each use.
1593544474.0,1,"Mine's the other way, super thick and fluffy but just a little longer. My lashes are SO short naturally, I think it only gives a 25% increase in growth so they were never gonna go ridiculous.

My father in law actually uses it for an eye condition he has (prescribed), he has to trim his lashes as they get so long he finds it embarrassing 😂"
1593471787.0,1,"The friend who has used it has very short and straight eyelashes. They said it does take a while to see results, which I think is true for most skincare products, but their lashes are definitely longer and more full. It took 3 months to finish using the tube.

It’s great that you found products that work for you. Would you be interested in maybe comparing results between Avance, DHC, and matsuge biyoueki after finishing the Avance?"
1593463732.0,4,That's so cool! I check it out some more. Thanks so much :)
1593468446.0,2,How do you apply it? I keep applying too much and then it feels so heavy
1593463759.0,2,"Oh, awesome, okay I'll keep my faith in castor oil haha. thanks so much! :)"
1593468639.0,3,may i know how do u apply? I image with a cotton bud and apply to the roots/lid area? or do u apply just to the tips of the lashes?
1593481107.0,2,Dang! I guess it depends on the person maybe? I recently read an article talking about how the natural oils do help condition your lashes and thicken them but it doesn’t actually make them longer. But then a lot of people say it works.
1593461115.0,2,I know milk makeup (non asian) has a good eyelash serum but I remember it being stupid expensive :( idk many AB ones besides etude house. Edit to say DHC one has been recommended by a friend
1593473253.0,1,"Croatia, Europe."
1593546575.0,1,Lol that’s amazing. He should just flaunt what he’s got!
1593473770.0,1,I will do group review here...but it will take a while. I like Japanese lash serum better because they don't sting my eyes and I can see the strengthening part. Actually aside from the one by Kiss Me Heroine Make (they had one before) most have some effect when I use them on the bald patch of my eyebrow.
1593469877.0,8,"I bought some castor oil, pipets, and empty lip gloss containers from Lotion Crafters and filled the empty lip gloss containers with Castro oil and I use the wand to dab a teeny bit on my lashes at night. 



I haven’t been using it long enough to see a difference yet but that’s an option if you’re looking for a way to apply it."
1593535291.0,2,I use an old mascara wand. I apply at night.
1593464197.0,2,"No problemo, def keep it up! You'll notice if you stop. I add some vitamin E oil to mine too. Not sure if it makes a big difference, but I've read a few times that it's also good for lashes/brows."
1593469359.0,8,"I order empty mascara tubes on Amazon for super cheap and just fill them up with half castor oil and half E oil. Super easy application for lashes and brows!

edit: and I apply all over my lashes and brows like mascara, wiggling the brush back and forth to really coat all the hairs. Apply more towards the tips of your lashes if you don't want it to get in your eyes a bit. Doesn't hurt or anything but it's annoying if you're up and active. I usually slather it on right before bed so i don't have to worry about that. I apply it with a lighter hand during most days when I don't have makeup on."
1593469072.0,1,No op but I use a clean mascara wand
1593461434.0,1,Oh interesting I'll check it out!
1593473708.0,1,"I see that yesstyle doesn't have it for Croatia, is it the same for jolse?"
1593486166.0,1,"I just bought 3 tubes from Stylevana the other day, maybe check them out as well?"
1593475737.0,1,Ive only ever ordered from yesstyle so I wouldn't know ;/ might check that other site you mentioned then
1593491653.0,40,Is this really medium tone?
1593470288.0,6,"After lusting at u/brownluvcony lovely swatches for the longest time, last week I bought a bunch of Romand lip products from Yesstyle. I placed order on June 20, shipped out June 22 and I received it June 28. I received free express shipping via Fedex, may be worth noting that all items in my order were shown as ""in stock, 1-2 days"".

My skintone is Armani LSF 5.5 but my arm is probably lighter than my face. Picture is taken in late morning with direct sun, the swatches from top to bottom:

* Glasting Water Tint in # 5 Rose Splash
* Glasting Water Tint in # 6 Purple Shower
* Glasting Water Tint in # 8 Rose Stream
* Juicy Lasting Tint in # 6 Figfig
* Zero Velvet Tint # 04 Burnt Heart
* Zero Layer Lipstick # M04 Fig Canon

I am a bit discouraged by the colors of Korean lip products. Colors that look muted on arms (even the most subdued one like Rose Stream or Apieu Water Tint RD03) appeared BRIGHT on my lips upon application, like it has a fuschia undertone or something. I wonder if this is done on purpose as I notice a lot of K-Pop stars often sports bright makeup. When I buy Korean lip stuff next time, I think I need to just go darker if I want muted MLBB-type of colors.

Formula Review:

**Glasting Water Tint** \-- thin non-sticky gloss with saturated color. These smell like soapy floral grape with awful fake sweetness, like Splenda-type, you know? Of all the lip products above, they have the strongest tint that stays even with oil makeup remover. Nice colors, just don't lick your lips :)

**Juicy Lasting Tint** \-- thin gloss with saturated color, slight stickiness. This one smells fruity (no soapy scent) and thank goodness, does not taste like anything. The smells reminds me of Apieu Water Tint and I wonder if the formula is actually dupe of each other. I wore this for an hour and my lips feels smoother because of the hydrating formula.

**Zero Velvet Tint** \- slightly mousse-y cream formula, has a lot of slip. Despite of having ""tint"" in the name, it does not seem to stain at all especially compared to Glasting Water Tint formula. There is a very, very slight non-offensive soapy scent. No taste, so all good!

**Zero Layer Lipstick** \- matte formula lipstick, more slip than Loreal Ultra Matte formula if you are familiar with it. No scent, no taste. All good too!

I had the most hope for Glasting Water Tint, but after I tried them all, my fave is Zero Velvet Tint formula. Thanks for reading!"
1593486257.0,3,I WANT THEM ALL
1593486850.0,3,I’m so flattered haha! I’m happy you like them especially the zero velvet tints which are a favorite of mine.
1593488722.0,3,I’m Armani LSF 5.5 so this might be the most helpful post of all time lol I want them all now!
1593492819.0,16,my skin tone (nw30-40) is typically considered medium 🙈so um ... op would probably be designated as light-medium or lighter ..
1593494164.0,2,You should try one of each formula to decide which one you like best. I am stuck with 3 soapy splenda gloss now 🤣
1593491206.0,4,"That's my fave formula too! Thank you for all your lovely swatches, I looked at them for the longest time before getting these 😍 I almost bought the milk tea series, but the waiting time for those are like, 21 days ... hell no, hahahha!

Any recs for darker, more muted color in Velvet Tints formula? LOL!! I like reddish brown or pink brown, no orange tones."
1593493273.0,2,"I am glad you find it useful! I highly recommend Zero Velvet Tint. If you can stomach the fake soapy sweetness, then maybe Glasting Water Tint 😬"
1593586629.0,2,I’m light to light medium and my skin looks darker than OP’s so I’m really confused
1593493164.0,1,"My color is usually within the ""medium"" range or ""light-medium"" at my palest 😊 so I just kinda follow that ..."
1593505526.0,3,"There are 20 new lipstick colors coming out tomorrow (+a ton of different lip tints) so wait until you see those! They posted a sneak peek post in the ""event"" category on their site. Seems like we'll be getting nudes and moody colors this time!!"
1593496281.0,2,"Deep Soul is a lovely red brown that doesn’t have any orange tones, but it’s very dark!! So you may have to wear it lightly if you want the red to stand out more than the brown. But it’s definitely possible to wear it that way, most swatches (including mine) just like to emphasize it by swatching it thickly

The new shade (coming out tomorrow) pecan tarte might be up your alley! It looks kinda pink brown but the swatches are kind of all over the place atm 😂"
1593497475.0,22,"whatever ranges you're using as a guide are seriously artificially truncated, just fyi"
1593550917.0,2,Looks like my skin tone which would be considered “fair”
1593529450.0,4,Craaaaappp ..! There goes my moolah! 😊
1593487884.0,12,I love the Canmake sunscreen! I have oily skin and it dries down beautifully without making it too matte. It definitely has a glow to it. The only thing I dislike is the price point (and the size!). It’s relatively cheap in Japan but it’s sold 2x the price in my country. I hope they release a bigger size in the future. 😭
1593487051.0,10,Would you recommend Canmake Mermaid Spf for people with really oil skin? Im using Purito Unscented spf now but I think it is a bit too heavy for my skin.
1593487201.0,4,"Agreed the canmake sunscreen has an amazing texture and comfortability, but do you still use it on days you're going to be outside for a long time?"
1593487258.0,3,"On YesStyle, the CANMAKE comes in clear and white. Which do you use so I order the correct one? Thanks!"
1593543230.0,4,Can anyone with medium or darker skintone let me know if the Canmake mermaid skin has a white cast? I'm around NC42 and have been bitten before when using a sunscreen that people with lighter skin said contained no white cast.
1593544394.0,4,I was thinking of the Canmake before I opened your post. It’s my HG too! I hope they keep making this sunscreen forever. It is *so* good.
1593486286.0,3,"hey, thanks for the extensive advice! where do you purchase the CANMAKE mermaid skin gel UV?"
1593486591.0,3,I've gone through like 10 tubes of this stuff lol
1593684120.0,3,"I've tried the Etude House and Skin Aqua products YEARS ago and was recently looking for an SPF to replace my cerave am moisturizer. I'm SO glad to hear I made the right choice by skipping Purito and Biore! I saw a few hidden rave reviews for the Canmake on here and just bought 2 from Dokodemo which I just got and started using! I'm in Canada too, and they charged about $10 for shipping for 3 products but it arrived within days. That's an option if you don't want to order a minimum to reach stylevanas free Canada shipping!"
1593488333.0,2,this makes me so excited to start on the canmake sunscreen! just gotta finish the klairs uv essence first!
1593543228.0,2,Im curious how a 60ml bottle could last you 3 months?
1593623903.0,2,Have you noticed any clogged pores from using this product? Do you have oily skin? It contains stearic acid which is not good for oily skin (has a comedogenic rating of 3) it’s so hard to find a product suitable for oily skin.
1593630166.0,2,I know what you mean! The Canmake UV Gel that I ordered literally just arrived today and I already love it.
1593830147.0,2,I also love the Canmake sunscreen! The only thing is it's not shiny for me during summertime. But I love it during winter.
1593497036.0,2,I love CanMake too! It's the prefect texture and that's all I use since 2 years. I do have a combination skin and would need to blot nose and forehead. But it's well worth it for me
1593805943.0,1,Is the can make physical or chemical? Thanks
1593940989.0,1,do you know if its effective/works well? :o i know some sunscreens in this sub have been sussed out about not protecting well. and also have you tried or heard about the cosrx aloe sun gel? i’ve been so stuck on what sunscreen i should get
1593534955.0,1,I could not agree more! It’s a minimum of a month delivery from Yesstyle or Stylevana for me (I’m too nervous to try EBay without someone recommending a specific seller).
1593512386.0,6,"I tried and thought so too! Im using the Klairs soft airy uv essence now and it absorbs a lot better but it does take sometime though. Other more pricey options are Paula's choice's super light daily wrinkle defence and THANN's oil-free facial sunscreen. The latter isn't very well-known but chanced upon it as a gift, and my oily skin loves it! P.S. I live in a very humid country"
1593529775.0,3,I have pretty oily skin and this is my fave sunscreen! It’s not greasy or heavy but it definitely gives a glowy look and doesn’t mattify at all. So even if I’m not wearing foundation I usually use a little bit of translucent powder.
1593518429.0,1,"I haven’t been, just because I prefer the hydrated feel and finish of the Biore on days that I don’t wear makeup (and because I feel guilty “wasting” the Canmake from the tiny bottle), but i would if I had no other option."
1593518908.0,3,"Yesstyle is not very clear on which option is what bottle, but it’s the one with the grey background and pink label."
1593609446.0,3,"No, not really. I just started using it, it’s initially a bit white but it absorbs very quickly and doesn’t leave a cast. I’m brown skinned."
1593497079.0,3,"I've been buying it on amazon, it's shipped from Japan"
1593518198.0,1,"Normally, I would say Yesstyle, but their minimums for free shipping to Canada right now is like $150, so I’ve been using stylevana. I find their product pricing is a bit more expensive but their shipping was a lot faster."
1593497112.0,2,Yes! First spf I've used consistently
1593521268.0,1,I’m so surprised it isn’t more common! I have yet to hear a negative review from someone using it.
1593712649.0,1,"I’m glad it was helpful! Thanks so much for the tip on Dokodemo, it looks super promising and I’m going to stock up."
1593518657.0,3,"I hear you on that! I love trying everything and anything recommended here or on SCA, so I swear I have at least 6 different products for every step in my routine on the go at any given time. Quarantine has been good for using that stuff up lol."
1593633677.0,1,I’m interested to know about this too. I’ve normal-dry acne prone skin and just started using it. Would rather stop before it gets too bad.
1593537852.0,2,I read that supergoop is dewier than canmake. Has anyone tried it so far? Thanks
1593518038.0,2,"I’ve heard the Klairs is really similar to the Purito, but the formula is a bit more tailored for oily skin. I haven’t tried it myself, so YMMV!"
1593531959.0,2,"Ah, makes sense. Thanks!"
1593533690.0,2,That's the clear one. Thanks a bunch!
1593551307.0,1,"I haven’t, but I really want to. The price turns me off a bit ($45 from Sephora)"
1593411578.0,36,"I bought a few skincare products from innisfree since one opened up near me. I agree with the comment regarding their ingredients :( so much fragrance! Mini rant about their other products: when starting out with skincare and not knowing much about ingredients, I purchased their volcanic clay mask that targets excess sebum and minimizes the appearance of pores. Fast forward to now where I’ve been able to learn and educate myself about skincare much more, I check the ingredients of the product and there’s walnut shell powder in it.."
1593401878.0,55,"\[Review\] Innisfree Green Tea Seed Skin

Recently, I’ve been trying new skincare products from my recent haul from Dodoskin ([dodoskin.com](http://dodoskin.com/)). I love being able to find my fave Korean brands, so there’s definitely going to be more hauls 💸.

About this product:

* consists of green tea extract and seed oil that are full of antioxidants and have antibacterial properties that can help clear your skin
* there is fragrance + limonene + linalool - ingredients that can be sensitizing and irritating :(
* includes glycerin that replenishes moisture to your skin
* has citric acid for chemical exfoliation

Review: 

Innisfree’s Green Tea Seed Serum was my very first skincare product that I tried and loved, so I decided to try another product from the line: the toner. This toner is very watery and includes green tea leaf extract and seed oil that provide antioxidants and hydration to your skin. There’s also citric acid which is an AHA (good for chemical exfoliating) and glycerin that provides more hydration to your skin. This is super cooling and refreshing on my skin, so it definitely wakes me up in the morning. My biggest issue with this is: fragrance. Sadly, there’s not only fragrance, but also limonene & linalool. These two ingredients (plus fragrance) can be quite sensitizing, so it definitely can cause issues for those with sensitive skin. Personally, this wasn’t my favorite toner based on the ingredients. I’ve used ones with better formulas, so I won’t be going back to this toner. 

How to use: 

After cleansing your skin, use a cotton pad and pour some toner onto it. Gently swipe it across your face, prepping your skin for absorbing other skincare products. Then, follow up with your normal skincare routine.

Skin recommendations: normal, dry"
1593403582.0,55,"This broke me out, and I don't normally have sensitive skin either :(

Smelled/felt good though."
1593411795.0,7,"I adore their green tea seed serum too, but I found the same issue with the strong fragrance! My skin's not really that sensitive, but there would even be days where the smell was so overwhelming that it made me kind of nauseous.... Do you still use it? Any recommendations for similar products but unscented?"
1593415973.0,8,"I'm glad this works for you! But I've tried several innisfree products and they all left my skin red, blotchy and irritated. Never trying them again. Their eyebrow pencil and pen liner is great for the money, however! That's the only thing I use that's from them now."
1593426011.0,7,Everything from innisfree breaks me out :( i really wanted to like this
1593422965.0,3,"Hi, I saw that you shopped on dodoskin. How is it? Is the shipping time ok? Do they give samples?"
1593442168.0,1,Loved the hydration but broke me out in tiny red bumps all over the face. :(
1593537218.0,1,Thank you for the honest review.
1593435199.0,8,"Sorry if it's obvious, but what's wrong with walnut shell powder? (I've never seen it used before)"
1593452127.0,10,I love that mask. Even if there is walnut shell in it I can't imagine it harms anything. You don't rub a mask in like you would with a cleanser.
1593408780.0,19,Same! And like OP I loveee the green tea seed serum - have been using it religiously for the past 6 years!
1593433302.0,6,"Same! I noticed that it made my skin really glowy and soft, but it also gave me a bunch of red bumps across my cheeks and made my face itch."
1593432721.0,3,I havent tried the serum but the matching balancing lotion and I haven’t been able to gell well it definitely deals me out. But i think it’s been too many coincidental bad skin days to keep using. It smells so good though it’s gonna be my body moisturiser when I’m going out
1593410374.0,2,Sensitive skins can be irritated by the citric acid in this product. Perhaps you’re more sensitive to citric acid than you assumed?
1593414924.0,2,"Broke me out too, and I don't break out easily from products"
1593429582.0,3,What is the green tea seed serum for? I've had it for a while but it really doesn't seem to do anything. It's also less hydrating than my other products 😐
1593450105.0,4,"Totally seconding this. It seems like all of their products contain problematic ingredients (fragrance and/or alcohol.) I kinda want to try the Green Tea Probiotics Cream (fragrance free,) but otherwise I have absolutely no interest in Innisfree products."
1593441908.0,6,"To me, it’s comparable to Yesstyle, but only carrying some makeup and many skincare products, and they give samples too. Shipping was fine and reasonable, but definitely check their website to see if they ship to your country because of the pandemic!"
1593459828.0,1,same!! my skin is pretty resilient to ingredients but for some reason their green tea line made me get a bunch of small red bumps
1593439885.0,10,"I think it's because walnut shells, when broken up, are really un-uniform and can be very jagged and sharp, so it damages your skin"
1593458729.0,3,I thought so too! I actually made a post not too long ago about it and people said that since you’re still spreading it across your face then the act of washing it of can still be harmful. I still want to use it and finish it up though :( do you also use a chemical exfoliator in your routine?
1593431859.0,1,Please recommend hydrating products 🥺🥺🥺🥺
1593464474.0,1,"I found it to be very hydrating on my skin! Leaves it nice and plump, but at the same time it's not too thick or greasy feeling. My skin is on the dry side, but not overly dry though. For example, I tried the La Neige Cream Skin and found it to be too heavy for everyday, and I'm really finicky about the finish that a product leaves. I'll still use it occasionally for emergencies though, like after a clay mask that leaves my skin super parched. So I guess the green tea serum was just enough hydration for me! Would you still recommend the Water Mask for something with normal to dry skin? It's not too heavy?"
1593446838.0,1,Yeah they do! Thank you :)
1593457112.0,2,Thank you!!
1593460891.0,10,"I only use it every two weeks or so. I use a chemical peel, then the mask, then scrub with an oil cleanser. It pulls so much of out of my pores that even if there's some small tears I'm not going to stop using it. Honestly I think people get too worked up about certain ingredients being off-limits. If it works for you and you don't notice a problem keep using it. If you find it makes your face worse then stop. As people love to say for skin care YMMV. 🤷‍♀️"
1593438192.0,5,"I love Laneige for hydration! Anything ""Water Bank"" is great. You may also want to try out Cosrx's Advanced Snail 96.

Also if your cheeks get dry over the course of the day (like mine does), check out Laneige Fresh Calming Morning Mist - it's not really popular for some reason (maybe still a new product), but keeps my cheeks really soft and moisturised all day!"
1593480456.0,1,"Honestly, some types of masks make me break out. The Water Mask is one of them. If you're purely asking about hydration though, it's fine! Just gotta wash off the residue the next morning"
1593458644.0,1,Np!
1593464137.0,1,"Cool...was just wondering, haha. Glad it works out for you!"
1593440222.0,4,"Similarly, I Highly recommend the water sleeping mask from Laneige. Super hydrating, I use it once or twice a week."
1593459712.0,1,The Corsrx Snail is one of our household holy grail products !

1593497849.0,3,"Hi,

Looking for recommendations for an alternative product to the COSRX one step original clear pads. Mainly after a product that contains the natural BHA ingredient Betaine Salicylate, at a low %. 

I love the COSRX pads, however, I’m afraid of developing contact dermatitis due to the swiping motion of the product (though I do try to pat it gently into my skin most the time), as Liah Yoo mentioned in one of her videos that this happened to her (not sure if it was this specific product, but it was a pre-soaked pad type of product). 

I use the COSRX pads after I shower as a toner. 

I have normal skin, a bit oily on t zone. I used to have mild hormonal acne on my chin (one to a few would pop up during the month), until I used the COSRX pads and now my skin is at its best. 

I live in Australia and it’s currently winter here but seasons don’t affect my skin much (I use the same routine year round).

My routine as below:

AM: 
- wash face with warm water
- cerave PM moisturiser 
- Klairs soft airy UV sunscreen SPF50+

PM:
- heimish all clean balm
- cerave hydrating cleanser
- COSRX one step original pads 
- COSRX advanced snail mucin power essence
- Cerave PM moisturiser 

Any recommendations would be appreciated as these pads have kept my hormonal acne on my chin at bay but I don’t plan on using it on my skin forever if it might cause long term damage. 

PS. I am quite new to the active ingredients game, so any tips are also appreciated in this realm!"

What would be a recommended AB product I can try to help minimize this? I've been using something called Smooth E cream my aunt gave me while in Thailand, which is promoted to heal scars but wanted to see if there's anything else. (I've also been covering my face with a mask because the doctor said to avoid any sun contact on the injury at all costs and... because of the pandemic. How convenient! 😆)"
1593523981.0,2,"Hi there, 

I have a question about cushion foundation. I live in Scotland and my skin type is combination. Do you recommend changing cushion in different season? Which one do you recommend? I haven't put makeup on since march and yesterday I used the cc cream from erborian, it made my skin look quite dull. So my other question is how do you know if a product is off? Thank you:)"

1593518652.0,1,"I’ve just started using some new products and I’ve noticed some texture starting to appear on my face. They aren’t turning into pimples per se, but my face has gotten blotchy and doesn’t feel perfectly smooth. I’ve added the CosRx BHA pads (1 - 2x per week), the CosRx 96% Snail Mucin Essence and the CosRx AHA and BHA toner spray. I think the issue is I used the toner spray every night for a week not realising that it should only be used every second day. Also wondering if it could be my bumps coming to the surface because of the AHAs/BHAs. The texture isn’t enough for me to stop anything as of yet, but I am wondering about it. Nothing else has changed in my routine. 


Also I know I shouldn’t have introduced everything at once so please don’t hound me about it - I won’t do it again haha!"
1593518653.0,1,I have been using the Cosrx Whitehead Power Liquid AHA 7 for about 4 weeks now. I purged initially but I think the worst is over now. I am currently still using it twice a week but I feel like I might see faster results with remaining spots if I used it more frequently? Any thoughts/suggestions welcome!
1593525299.0,1,"Hello! Looking for some recommendations for some ultra moisturizing, super hydrating products. Serums, essences, ampoules, moisturizers, anything!

my issue is I believe I’ve messed up my skin barrier by overexfoliating at one point. It’s been months since I’ve cut back on any exfoliation and I’ve been using products with ceramides, but nothing seems to be helping. It’s just my jaw line that is experiencing this dryness. No flakiness, just tightness. 

The rest of my skin is more on the normal side with an oily T-zone. My skin isn’t too sensitive or acne prone. I live on Northeastern US coast, so right now in the summer, it’s relatively humid. 

Here is my current routine, it’s pretty much the same for both AM and PM

• Cleanser AM - Bioderma Sensibo H2O micellar water
• Cleanser PM - Lagom Cellup Gel to Water cleanser
• Toner - I’m From Rice Toner
• Essence - Muji Moist Essence Lotion
• Serum - I’m From Ginseng serum
• Moisturizer - currently testing out the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion
• SPF - Banila Co Hello Sunny Hydrating SPF Essence"

1593517037.0,4,"contact dermatitis is usually cause by the product itself and not really from the swipping motion of pads.  I mean if it does, i probably develop contact dermatitis from using cotton pads everyday to apply my toner.   it is just pads kind of products are usually more expensive than just buying the 100ml products.  I use the By Wishtrend Quod Active Boosting essence.  it is pretty weak but still check the ingredient list.  I used the cosrx pads in the past and it was alright but just expensive to keep on using daily."
1593498475.0,3,COSRX has another BHA product called BHA Blackhead Power Liquid. You can just use your hand to apply it on your face
1593529766.0,3,"Yes I didn’t get a confirmation email, they just emailed me when the goods where dispatched a few days later."
1593535954.0,3,Haha the multiple benefits of masks! I’ve used the Cosrx Snail 96 essence on cuts or picked pimples sometimes to see if it helps with scarring and in my experience it does.
1593536582.0,2,"Oh no! As someone who got into an accident that required stitches on my eyebrow, I feel your concern about the scar. Back then I didn’t use AB, and plain old broke open vitamin E gel capsules and smeared them on the scar for a while. The color goes away after a year or so, and after 5 years, I only notice the crescent outline. Good luck!"
1593552551.0,1,I like the jungsaemmool cushion. What do you mean by off? I actually find it quite hard to find a match in cushions because the shade ranges tend to be pretty limited.
1593536184.0,5,"It’s not the SPF! You’re using it fantastically, but besides exfoliation you may want to look into alternating between that and a product that lightens hyperpigmentation: vitamin C, alpha arbutin, lactic acid, snail mucin, retinol, etc. look up products in the sub and good luck!"
1593553411.0,4,"Speaking as someone who is prone to PIH, 2 months is not long enough in terms of fading it unfortunately, at least for me. I have some really stubborn spots that have taken nearly a year to disappear completely! I would keep doing what you’re doing and make sure to take progress pictures, because it’s likely fading already but it’s hard to tell small differences."
1593616392.0,2,"I had the same problem but on my cheek area. Had a collection of 3 or 4 spots that left reddish/ brown marks (is that PIH or PIE? Never could get it right...) 

Like you I was using a high spf and pa rated sunscreen, and Melano CC (it helps! But very gradually) but it was still there after 2-3 months (very noticeable when the rest of your face is clear!)

What really helped them to fade was when I incorporated an emulsion into my routine. The added hydration and moisture evened out the sallow areas of my face and made the spots fade out. And this was with toners/ moisturizers that I felt were sufficiently hydrating/ moisturizing for my skin. I notice that emulsions really add that thin layer of protection that helps everything come together nicely. Sleeping masks can also perform a similar function, but I prefer emulsions + moisturizer/ sleeping mask now that the weather is warmer and more humid."
1593519952.0,2,The AHA BHA toner spray is a pH lowering toner so my guess is that it is breaking you out. It should not cause any sort of purging because the amount of acids are incredibly minuscule at 0.1% AHA and 0.1% BHA. Ofc it could be the other products you introduced recently too...
1593528381.0,1,Aha  and bha is useful for diminishing texture actually. However the extremely low concentration of both aha bha in the toner and pad means that it is most likely other ingredients in the same product breaking you out.
1593519806.0,3,"It is fine to slowly work your way up to alternate days, then everyday if your skin can handle it. It's also fine if your skin is too sensitive to handle everyday. Just listen to your skin and adjust accordingly."
1593540455.0,2,If your skin barrier is the source of your problems I suggest trying to find ingredients that heal or soothe. I usually use aloe face masks when my skin barrier is compromised followed by other humectant heavy skin care. I personally like Holika Holika honey sleeping pack after a face masks to lock in hydration.
1593536427.0,1,"Hi! Currently on the west coast but lived on the east coast for five years. I love the hanskin hyaluron essence. Very buildable. The innisfree orchid cream is decent but not crazy amazing. The acwell licorice toner is watery but layering gives a nice, first step in hydration(think plumping); it also has an added bonus of helping  fade acne scars or pigmentation (but at a slower rate than actives). I’m testing out the enature birch juice hydrating sleeping mask for the last 2 weeks and am enjoying it so far!"
1593617213.0,1,"Aloe Vera gels are great for adding quick soothing hydration, but you would need to use a thicker occlusive to keep that hydration in if your skin still feels tight. 

When my moisture barrier was compromised, IOPE Derma Repair Cica Cream was amazing for helping to heal it. It's not too thick so perfect for summer, and it really made my skin feel softer than other thicker/richer creams. 

If you want to give it a try you can get samples of it from roseroseshop!"

1593560352.0,1,Yes. I consider our skin routine like brushing your teeth and going to the facialist like going to the dentist.
1593616758.0,1,"You could try chemical exfoliation. AHAs (glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic etc) work on the surface and BHAs (salicylic acid) work within the pores. Go slowly if you're just starting!! Once or twice a week, then move up to 2 or 3 times once you're used to it.  

Always make sure to sufficiently hydrate and moisturize if not you risk making it worse! Small bumps could mean dehydrated skin, so try to start with layers of thin hydrating toners and see if that helps."
1593554875.0,1,I use it every morning before moisturizer and SPF. I don't have sensitive skin and I can handle using it everyday without any irritations. Other people say that they experienced itching and stinging when they use it so it's best to patch test first.
1593552344.0,2,"In my experience, there are good deals at any given time. But you have to price compare with eBay.

I highly recommend getting a sunstick for reapplication (outdoors or indoors) cause you don't need to use your hands and it works mostly fine above makeup (I usually only use a thin layer of loose powder to tone down shine/ even out skin tone).

Some non-sticky ones I've found are the Papa Recipe Honey Moist Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++ (bought it for winter but it's still working great in hot weather now) and AHC ones (I have 2, they both seem pretty similar)"
1593553226.0,2,"Vaseline is probably the most inert occlusive out there, although it is just that and nothing else. If you just need occlusion, Vaseline is great.

1593557442.0,1,"> It’s not the SPF! 

Yes, it very well could be. If there is very low protection in UVA1 it will not help much, if at all. PA++++ says nothing about UVA1 protection and the PA++++ formulations I've examined look to be very low in UVA1. This is why many of us insist on PPD 30 or higher which is generally heavier euro formulations.

Adding regular exfoliation will help speed up the process, i.e. a glycolic at 8-10% and pH 3.5 or below."

1593564995.0,1,Very good point! I’ve heard good things about the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask and Aritaum Ginger Sugar Overnight Lip. Have you ever used either of these products?
1593580117.0,1,Yes that would make sense. Thanks for easing my mind!
1593580097.0,1,It contains betaine salycilate too. So it could be what you are after :)
1593536691.0,3,It could just be that the product itself is not strong enough for you or the right product!
1593648007.0,1,"In my case it did! 

I think sufficiently moisturizing your skin helps it to heal and turnover over by itself. And I know it's difficult to find a light enough moisturizer for humid weather, hence the emulsion recommendation. 

Also a retinol really speeds up the turnover process, so I'd suggest getting one if you weren't already using it. Look for one with an airless pump if it's a cream, or with a dropper if it's in oil (like TO retinol 0.5%)"
1593566819.0,1,"I apply 2-3 drops on the whole face. Yeah, it does! I have reddish acne in my cheeks before I used it and after few days, the acne flattened and the scar is barely visible now :) I love this serum!"
1593632607.0,2,"Well ingredients wise it’s kind of similar, but that’s as close as they get. The Ampoule is incredibly thick, and instead of being used around the serum step they recommend you use it after moisturizer as an occlusive. It’s like a gel and it forms this protective layer on your skin once it dries, but it doesn’t stay sticky like when first applied"
1593575014.0,1,"I’ve been on accutane twice and I’ll say that neither are going to be hydrating and moisturizing enough for the dryness that your lips will experience while on accutane. It’s not ab or cutesy like lip masks, but a huge tube of good old Aqupaphor or CeraVe Healing Oitment will be your best friend for your lips and are way more effective as lip masks.

However, I highly recommend also getting a few tubes of a lip balm called Dr. Dans Cortibalm. It was created specifically for accutane patients experiencing extremely dry, chapped lips. It has 1% hydrocortisone to help help heal the inflammation and chapped skin on your lips. It’s only available online as far as I know, and it’s a little pricey, but it was definitely a lifesaver and well worth the price. During my first course, I only used aquaphor which relieved my chapped lips temporarily during the day. But when I started my second course, I discovered cortibalm which saved and actually healed my lips, so I ended up only using this all the time. Regardless, I still do recommend both, cortibalm to help heal and aquphor as an occlusive for your lips. I still use cortibalm even after accutane, honestly the best lip balm I’ve ever used. 

Taking a look at the rest of your routine, I honestly would not overload it with too many products, especially if you have sensitive skin. All you truly need is a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, and then maybe a hydrating layer. In my opinion after going through this twice, focusing solely on Ab products was not the best when it came down to building an accutane routine. Western products were much more effective, especially when it came down to moisturizing, while AB products, like hydrating toners or essences, did help to soothe and alleviate some of the dehydration. So my recs aren’t really going to be AB sorry

For a cleanser, I recommend a gentle creamy cleanser. La Roche Posay Ultra Hydrating Cleanser is what I used for my courses. I initially used Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, but it made my skin tingle for some reason, so I stopped using it. Obviously YMMV but I do think the LRP is the better option for the size alone, it comes in a gigantic 430ml bottle that will last you months. It’s very gentle, soothing and hydrating like the name implies. I love the cosrx cleanser, but it’s not the best option while on accutane because it’ll be too drying for your skin.

Moisturizer, you’ve probably heard this a million times, but I recommend simply CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion or Cream. I don’t like the texture of the cream, I used the lotion 
during my courses because it absorbs faster and didn’t  leave my skin feeling stuffy. Some people use both, it depends on how severe your dryness is. You’ll be going through a ton of moisturizer while on accutane, which is why I’d recommend something that’s easy to buy here and affordable. I have heard illyoon was nice, though I can’t speak on it personally so I have no idea if it will be moisturizing enough for accutane skin. The Cosrx lotion will definitely not be moisturizing enough.

I’d personally hold off with all the extras, like the essence and oils, until after you start your course. Within the first couple of weeks, or even days, you’ll experience first hand how drastically your skin will change, and from there on you can adjust accordingly. I did use the HL premium, which was great for hydration, so that’s something that you can use for a hydrating layer.

Hope this helped, feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. /r/Accutane  is also a good source of information/discussion too."

1593690396.0,1,"In terms of Light moisturisers, I use the Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid lotion. I have the normal, LIGHT, and Premium version. In humid weather, is the LIGHT version better or the thicker and Premium version?

And yes I already am using TO retinol 0.5 in squalene EVERY 3 days at night. Though after adding it I always feel as if it isn't absorbing enough (I use 4 drops btw)? My face is relatively oily and sometimes I wait for 10 minutes before adding my moisturiser. Any tips?"
1593635835.0,2,Oooh sounds like exactly what I’m looking for! I already use the toner and love it. Thanks so much!!
1593732005.0,1,"I believe for most japanese products lotion means toner, and milk means emulsion. I can't say which is better, but go with the one that works best/ absorbs most easily with your skin. 

It's great you're already using a retinol! Squalane can feel a little heavy on the skin, especially in humid weather. I've found that mixing the oil directly with moisturizer helps to cut down on the greasy feeling. And if your skin can tolerate the retinol every 3 nights, it may be worth working your way up to applying every night to really speed up the turnover."
1593635896.0,2,"I use the toner and love it too, hope you like it if you do try it out!"
1593791633.0,1,Ok ty !
1593529242.0,7,"Sorry this is a bit long, but I'm really excited because it's my first ever skincare [haul](https://imgur.com/a/78fDxAp)! And it's from PinkNBlossom. I highly recommend this retailer, fast shipping from Canada and they also have a huge sale right now. This comes out to about $110 for price reference, which makes each product about $11 (the small size stuff/mask + sample are free gifts), which I think, is quite a good deal!  

Before this, I've had a simple routine of about 2 years (before that I mostly just splash my face with water....), consisting of cleanser and mostly Hada Labo lotion + milk. They do work to hydrate, but recently, I have felt they either stopped working, or my skin just doesn't like hyaluronic acid *as much*. It's still one of those products that are very gentle and doesn't cause any irritation on my skin though, so I probably will still keep them around.  

About 2 months ago, I also bought (non-AB) Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel-cream and Rosehip seed oil. The Neutrogena moisturizer is okay, but doesn't seem like it's doing much while I do really like the Rosehip oil, it seems to calm my redness.   

I've been reading a lot recently about Asian skin care, particular those with propolis/bee pollen extract, so I wanted to get those (the  Missha bee pollen renew kit as introductory kit to the line, and Cosrx propolis light ampoule). 

I also wanted to get some toners/asian lotion that is not Hada Labo, i.e. has more than just HA, so I got the Soon Jung Relief toner, Pyunkang Yul Essence toner (just tried this out twice, and been liking it so far), and out of curiosity, the Missha Super Aqua Snail essence. Unfortunately PnB doesn't list all the product's ingredients so I didn't realize this one has fragrance quite high on the list, probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise. If anyone has tried this, I'm curious about your opinion!  

Most excited about the Mizon Black AIO snail cream. Been hearing a lot about snail, and I hope to replace this snail cream for the Neutrogena Hydroboost. And maybe if I need some extra hydration, or when my skin just likes gentle moisturizer, I'll end the routine with Soon Jung 2x Intensive Barrier cream.  

This was definitely a lot of products; it's really my first time spending so much on skin care, and I most likely won't use all at once, but I wanted to splurge a little in this quarantine, and try out a few products that I've been hearing a lot.  

Hopefully in a few months when I've tried most of them, I can write something up! :)"

1593513066.0,8,"Any reason for only looking at AB products? I do experience some hyperpigmentation and acne problem, and my go to treatments and actives are generally western products. IMO AB products are generally soothing and calming in nature, while Western have better actives and treatments. Depending on your age and skin type, what you are doing is enough and you just have to wait a little longer. Perhaps you can try Paulas choice C15 booster for a more potent one, and maybe increase your BHA concentration. You can also consider introducing retinol to your skin slowly!"
1593525742.0,5,"Personally I’ve had the most luck fading acne scars with the Melano CC.

If you were like me and kept picking at your face and your scars are baaaad, try some at home derma needling (be safe and clean!!!!)

1593518901.0,3,The Ordinary’s Azelaic Acid was a game changer for me. I used to mod /r/skincareaddiction and tried literally everything popular there & none of it ever really changed owt other than that and tea tree oil mixed with my moisturiser.
1593545827.0,2,"How do you like the IUNIK Centella Calming Gel Cream? I have one IUNIK product (the beta-glucan serum) and love it.  


Here's my routine (dry, acne/clog-prone, medium/dark skin - I'm South Indian). I'm focused on hydrating, healing + fading PIH from picking. I get PIH easily and before AB it was much more stubborn to fade. These are products which have been gentle on my compromised skin and have also noticeably sped up healing - both in terms of open wounds and PIH:

  
**HG**  
**Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 Relief Toner** (a favorite on this sub. Noticeably soothing & I feel like it helps my other products penetrate better)  
**Melano CC** (this stuff works so well for my PIH)  
**IUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum** (game changer for me in terms of adding hydration, I also read that beta-glucan stimulates collagen production)  
**CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** (snail is one of my healing holy grails! this for me is not hydrating enough on its own but good after the IUNIK serum or mixed with a some aloe vera gel. Seriously helps my acne + picked spots heal much faster)  
**Rosehip seed oil** (night only) - I use a small amount and only put this on my cheeks + PIH. Apparently acneic skin can be lacking in linoleic acid which this then supplies. Rosehip has really been helping with my PIH and it feels sooooo nice on my skin. I did noticed little CCs on my chin when I used it there after a few nights, but I just stopped using it there and it's been fine. I recommend trying it out but starting slow - just use it to spot treat at first maybe? As an oil/occlusive it would go at the end of your routine

**Also great but started using recently:**  
Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel - I had been looking for a light preferably gel moisturizer to go over the serum + snail, but I find most moisturizers too heavy  (weirdly even though I have dry skin), this has a really nice texture and doesn't break me out, plus additional humectants  + wound healing from the HA. I seriously have tried so many moisturizers that my skin hates, RIP wallet. Love this so far, will RP.  
Isntree Green Tea Moist Emulsion - Antioxidants and sebum controlling properties but gentle, one of the few things I can use on my nose which gets SF's easily. Also got salix alba (willow) bark extract a goodie for acne as it mildly exfoliates and reduces inflammation. Expires 6mo after opening product though (I think?) and idk if I'll use it all up. Likely RP.  


**SPF** \-  I'm honestly still searching and always on the lookout (anybody who got one pls hit me) but rn my fav is the Purito Centella Unscented. I tried it once previously and thought maybe it broke me out (I'm paranoid about sunblocks + clogs in general) but have since gone back and .. oh my god. It's almost everything I dreamed of. Beautiful texture, alcohol-free, HYDRATING, madecassoside + centella for healing, dewy (but not too dewy) finish, brightening, sign me right up! I say ALMOST because it's not something I would be comfortable wearing in a situation where I was spending a lot of time directly in the sun or like doing outdoor activities in the summer - it's not water resistant and more of an everyday sunscreen. I put it on as my protection when I'm around the house and when I walk the dog (after 4pm). 

Before this I was using LRP Shaka fluid everyday which has higher protection and great texture but the alcohol in it was really drying for my skin in a way I honestly didn't even realize until I switched...it never broke me out at least. I wish they would reformulate without the alcohol :(  I get sketched out too cause so many US sunscreens (and some AB ones!) use chemical filters that have been linked to endocrine (hormone) disruption and have been shown to penetrate the skin and linger in the bloodstream. I'm not a scientist so literally what do I know really, but the long term possible cumulative effects worry me and keep me obsessively researching sunscreens.

My HG spot treatment for active spots/acne - **Etude House AC Clean Up Pink Powder Spot**. Salicyclic acid on its own has never been particularly effective on my spots, I think the sulfur helps by soothing while allowing the salicyclic acid to do its job?  


I also love using sheet masks - in particular snail sheet masks :) 

If you like your Vit C great, if not I recommend trying Melano CC! It's gentle, lasts ages and one of the most stable formulations out there. I was also gonna recommend niacinamide but see you have that already! There's also acids for resurfacing/pigmentation obviously but rn I don't have any in my routine, I'll let others who use those recommend :) 

Overall: I feel like (for my skin) making it the gentlest and most hydrating routine possible has really helped me. Also crucial has been not picking at my skin and listening to my skin when I apply new products - I'm bad about patch testing but I have at least gotten more in tune to my skin and have weeded out products that I previously thought were helping. It's hard to sift through all the marketing bullshit out there, and then even when it's sincerely not bullshit, skincare is such a YMMV, am I right? 

I know from experience how annoying and discouraging it can be, sending some positivity :)"
1593537305.0,1,"I LOVE the Melano CC Vitamin C Serum - a few drops covers my whole face, neck, and backs of my hands. I feel like it's given me brighter skin, and any blemish marks fade really quickly.

For about 6-7 months now, I've been using TO Niacinamide Serum and believe that is helping with any hyperpigmentation. I know this product tends to be kind of polarizing, and some folks have had bad experiences with this. I have fairly sensitive skin, and I've been loving this. It's a strong concentration, so I apply with some CosRx Snail Mucin Essence.

On that note: I'm a sucker for snail products, and feel that they help nourish and heal my skin. Like many ABers, I love the Mizon Cream Gel, but also rotate in the Secret Key Snail Repairing Essence. Got a bug bite? BOOM! Snail cream! The itch disappears and any redness is gone."
1593539562.0,1,"Vitamin C should help with dark spots & brightening - the timeless you mentioned would be great. An AB option is the melano cc which works quite well and is very gentle (in my experience).

You may also have some luck by rotating your PC BHA with an AHA which can help with superficial scars/marks. A good AB option is the krave kale-lalu-yAHA 

Also the 10% azelaic acid booster from paula's choice is one of my favourite do-it-all products that really helps my complexion overall!"

1593440280.0,9,Exfoliating and moisturizing is key. Laser hair removal can help too. I had KP on my legs. AHAs like lactic acid is usually recommended. I have dry dehydrated skin so I use a body butter and that helped a lot.

I've had it my entire life. In fact, my mom told me she asked the doctor who delivered me about it and he said it'll go away in a few months. 32 years later and nope."
1593453475.0,4,Exfoliating can help but as well as products with urea mine has gone down alot to where its only noticable if you touch my skin or really pay attention but my doctor said it might be do to age rather than products since there really isnt anything to make it go away completely for it my sister completely went away on its own after she had kids

For me, the Italy towel works best towards the end of a shower, when my skin has had a chance to get really saturated. It's tempting to rub too hard, but even a gentle scrub has been effective (just sort of using the weight of my hand). While my skin is still damp from the shower, I apply a generous layer of the Gold Bond and I'm good to go. 

I found AmLactin almost too powerful, and experienced some uncomfortable tingling/burning sensation. Plus, it's a pretty pricey drugstore lotion, while the Gold Bond is easy to catch on sale at Target."

1593367038.0,25,"3CE TAKE A LAYER MULTIPOT IN CABBAGE ROSE

Ingredient list https://www.skincarisma.com/products/3ce/take-a-layer-multi-pot/ingredient_list

*I have combination acne-prone skin. My T-zone and chin can get really oily, while my cheeks lean more on the drier side.

DESCRIPTION: An airy matte collection that can be blended freely, and gives a comfortable finish to the lips and cheeks as if nothing is applied. With a creamy sliding texture that melts onto skin for long-lasting color.

APPLICATION: I applied it on my eyes and lips with my fingers and used a damp beauty blender for my cheeks and found it easy to apply. It does not set very quickly, leaving room and time to blend. It sets on the skin beautifully and looks really natural.

FORMULA: Quite pigmented! I feel like it's gonna take a long time before I pan this. It has a creamy powder texture and a finish that's matte but not cakey or dry. If you do use this on the lips, I recommend using a lip balm beforehand.

COLOR & LONGEVITY: Cabbage Rose is described as an ""understated deep rose hue"". Imo, it's a rosy coral shade with peach tones. This shade is one of the bestsellers in this range, but tbh I find the color to be basic. It's beautiful but not special, which makes it perfect for a ""My lips/cheeks but better"" look. On my cheeks and my eyes, it lasted for about 10 hours (lessened in pigment around the 6 hour mark). I wore a mask in between and it didn't budge or create any weird lines. As for my lips, maybe around 4 hours (without eating or drinking)."
1593403877.0,6,"thank you for the review! i've been interested in these for so long (and in a lot of different shades) but given the price and current shipping lags from skorea, i've been holding off on buying them (plus i have so many cream blushes already lol). cabbage rose was one of the top shades i was considering so knowing that it's basic, i can perhaps take it off my list 😂 were there other shades that you were interested in as well? also, would you say the finish (on cheeks) is matte no matter the base makeup? i like to use cream blush on bare skin, and usually my skin is anywhere between tacky and greasy (depending on the sunscreen i use), so it might be weird if i have a matte blush circle on top of that

thanks in advance! and you look so great in the photo! 😊"
1593406399.0,3,"can you describe in great detail for application on your cheeks? do you take the product and dot it on your cheeks then blend or? 
also where do you put the product & spread it? (high points on cheekbones to front cheeks? temples?) 
how much of the product do you use for your cheeks, eyes and lips?

ty for the review! i bought this shade and had it for quite a while but never reached for it. we’re similar in facial features and skin tone so i’m excited to try it again 😊"
1593416078.0,3,I have a multi pot in Diotima and I really like it as a blush or under  lipbalm. My eyelids are so oily that the multi pot on it's own doesn't last but I haven't tried it over an eye primer yet.

1593555775.0,1,I love their Diotima and Holly Hock! 😍
1593404917.0,6,"Not OP but I wear this in 2 other shades (primula, common time) on days I wear makeup. They are a natural finish on skin with no base makeup, I don’t think it’s super matte, which I prefer."
1593409496.0,1,"It's more of a natural sheer matte. I actually only have a bit concealer on my cheeks and undereye and didn't use any powder to set my face. My skincare makes me greasy as well (I like to layer my toners and moisturizersss), but I found this product played well into that, making my cheeks less oily looking and just ""dewy"". 

I'm thinking of picking up Diotima as well, but I'm thinking of trying out other cream blushes from different brands since I just started using them after thinking for so long it will only disrupt my base makeup because of the formula. Do you have any favourites from your collection? 😊"
1593408361.0,7,"I dab a clean damp beauty blender directly on the pan and then dab it on my cheeks! Even though it's quite pigmented, the wet sponge doesn't pick up a lot of the cream product so it makes it buildable and easy to spread. I usually start applying blush from the high points of my cheekbones then to the front of my cheeks. I found focusing it on the apples of my cheeks drags my face down. 

The product is very buildable and pigmented, so it doesn't really take that much. I don't like to go full opaque with my lip products so just one finger swipe for my lips is enough and I just feather it out. I use even less product for my eyes, like maybe one pinky finger swipe for both of my eyes' upper lid and lower lash line.

Excited for you! I hope you have fun with it! :)"
1593407786.0,3,"thank you! that’s great to know — i would prefer the natural finish for both bare skin days and makeup days (i go for dewy finishes with my makeup)

so my top cream/liquid blushes are actually non-ab ones (such as the the kosas color + light, daniel sandler watercolor blush, em cosmetics serum blush), but some ab ones i've tried and liked are the NAMING playful creme blush and the CLIO pro tinted veil blusher. both of these have slightly dewy finishes, with the CLIO being a bit more sheer. a few others i've tried that have more of a matte finish (almost powdery-cream) the Peripera pure blushed velvet cheek and the Tonymoly Cheektone Cream"
1593408519.0,1,"I’m about a light medium and neutral undertone with naturally red cheeks, usually 25 in Asian shades. The orange on me looks more coral when I don’t have base makeup, not necessarily bad. I think it’s the only flattering orange I’ve ever found in my life. My friend is more fair skin and olive toned and it looks really nice on her too, it almost doubled as a bronzer because it looks like she’s been in the sun ☀️"

1593458374.0,3,My holy grail sunscreen is canmake mermaid skin gel uv but it’s not water resistant for that my favorite is biore uv aqua rich watery essence. Body sunscreens I really like are aqua skin and suncut aqualy protect gel. They’re all SPF 50+ and PA++++
1593615053.0,3,"I'm in the US.  I use ebay a lot.  My HG sunscreen is Rohto's Skin Aqua Super Moisture line.  I have VERY dry sensitive skin.  I also don't have fungal acne, but I get similar reactions to some ingredients, so I try to stick to ""safe"" products.  Skin Aqua is all PA++++ /SPF 50+ (I won't use less).  I use the Super Moisture Milk (gold bottle) if I need waterproof, even works on my face.  If I don't, I use the Super Moisture Essence on my face and the Super Moisture Gel on my body.  It's a drugstore brand, so the prices are reasonable.  If you're unfamiliar with Japanese products, esp skincare and sunscreen, make sure to check out Ratzilla.  The products get reformulated a lot, and Ratzilla is invaluable for me in making sure I get the newest product."

1593447395.0,2,"Oily skin here. Canmake’s sunscreen is my favorite since it doesn’t have alcohol and the finish isn’t too matte. It leaves the face with a glowy look imo. I don’t think it’s waterproof though so I only use it when I’m stuck in the office! Definitely not for outdoors I think. 

I also really like Melano CC (Vitamin C) since the packaging ensures that it won’t oxidize quickly.

Shu Uemura has its own site with frequent sale (their color makeup and brushes lost their appeal under loreal management though).

For skincare I use whatever at the moment but I love the sheer lipsticks by various Japanese brands from Cezanne to Three they are clear, moisturizing and very flaterring."

1593549459.0,1,"Try Takashima ([https://www.etakashimaya.com/index.php](https://www.etakashimaya.com/index.php)) if you're in the U.S., I've been getting a lot of stuff from them recently and they have some more obscure skincare and wash stuff too. They're based out of CA I believe and have pretty fast shipping in the states. They carry a lot of HG favorites like Melano CC, Naturie, Hada Labo, Biore and Skin Aqua sunscreens etc., though their makeup selection is lacking apart from Canmake items, which they have a ridiculous amount of--they're Canmake's official retailer in the U.S.. Prices are reasonable, especially if you're looking for Canmake stuff and are concerned about counterfeits. I just did a huge Canmake haul from them and everything was packaged so nicely, none of the blushes and eyeshadows I brought were damaged. 

I also highly recommend Flowfushi's eyeliner, it's my HG liquid liner. The precision of the brush tip is insane. They rebranded as UZ in the U.S., and have a website you can order directly from. Canmake's pencil eyeliner is also pretty good, but the twist function is effed in that you can't make the product go back into the pencil. 

I also have raved about this before in the community, but Cure Aqua Gel is also fantastic. It's a gommage peeling gel, and takes everything off really well. It's one of my favorite exfoliating products."

1593536705.0,1,I use the pink bottle. It is a mattifying primer so is probably best for normal to oily skin. I'm oily and it works so well for me. I buy several bottles at a time as it's quite affordable.
1593486625.0,1,Yes the biore has alcohol and it also has fragrance but I don’t find the smell too offensive
1593643242.0,1,"I have no loyalty, provided they have at least 97% positive feedback and the shipping is either free or not ridiculous.  I might use estimated arrival date or including samples as a tie-breaker if everything else is the same.  

The sunblock I mentioned just changed formulation, so my criteria for those was a pic of the actual sunblock and not a stock pic, to make sure I was getting the new stuff and not the old stock.  Or if the ad specified ""new formulation"" that might sub for the actual pic.  

One thing to note right now is that I think Japan post is either still shut down or really restricting mail.  Normally a million people have this stuff.  My last order I limited to US sellers who had the new product.  It was a small pool.  Have Ratzilla open when you order to check the pics, and good luck!"

I don’t mind small pimples, since I know they’ll eventually go away. I have a few acne scars but I don’t focus on getting rid of them (I do find them annoying though). Skincare should be relaxing and not stressful. I think comparing ourselves to celebrities (idols, actors, etc.) is useless since they get expensive skin treatments and have to look good for their jobs. But not even all celebrities have “perfect” skin, idols + actors do get acne (it’s the lighting that helps hide it). Models don’t have “perfect skin” either. When I was looking at backstage photos of models, I saw many models who had acne, facial hair, etc. and it made me feel better."

2) No acne scars

I’m ok with blackheads, texture and redness. To me, these are normal skin things that we’re all born with."

My skin had always been pretty clear, apart from the occasional black and whiteheads. 

Last year I suddenly started breaking out on my cheeks and my forehead and my neck. I felt so down and lost a lot of confidence. 

Now my skin is smooth, and pretty clear again. The biggest thing that has made me happy was feeling how smooth my skin is whenever I wash it compared to when I used to have acne. 

So I guess perfect skin for me would be smooth, feels strong, and doesn’t feel sensitised."
1593369858.0,22,"Ideally for me my perfect skin would be: 
- Hydrated 
- No Closed Comedones
- No/Minimal Redness (I get really patchy irritated skin) 
- No Hormonal Chin Acne 

I’ve honestly kinda given up on trying to fix these issues myself. Almost everything stings on me so finding a simple moisturizer is hard enough. As for the CC’s and Redness I’ve never seen improvement on that part no matter what I do. So my perfect skin is just making sure it’s hydrated and it doesn’t react."

1. Smooth texture, mainly referring to no/few closed comedones & less overall acne. 
2. Semi-even complexion. So no/few sunspots, hyperpigmentation, etc. 

OTC Products only did so much for my skin so tretinoin has contributed to both goals so far."
1593373022.0,14,"I’ve had skin issues my entire life, from when I was a child (sensitive-combo, eczema and cystic acne prone, and pores galore). I started dabbling in AB earlier this year (quarantine glow-up, I guess) after struggling to find solutions for decades. Dermatologists, aestheticians, specialty products...all gave me *ok* results. 

Last week, I (very gently) exfoliated my skin, and for the first time ever, my skin felt *smooth* afterwards instead of “otherwise smooth, but with what feels like dense beads lying underneath”.  Constant redness, daytime sheen, and outbreaks of eczema are subsiding (winter will be a test). 

I wake up in the morning with soft smooth skin now, not a bump to be felt anywhere on my cheeks, and that has become my redefined “good”.  

Ideally, I’ll be able to tackle some scarring discoloration and general unevenness in tone, and that would bring me to my personal “perfect”."
1593356082.0,22,"In my opinion, for my skin, I’ll be happy once my skin has no redness and no breakouts ever. I like my texture and my skin is pretty clear generally (I would like to keep it that way) but the redness always gets to me.

1593362193.0,9,"All I want is no acne marks or acne. After what I’ve gone through, I’m ok with a little oiliness, texture, and redness. I just don’t want any sign of acne, so I’ll feel comfortable without covering up my skin. I’ll get there someday."
1593358517.0,7,"My face is extremely acne-prone (Accutane has luckily nuked a lot of it), so good skin would be no spots ever again.

Perfect skin would be no spots + no more redness. My face flares up easily. I hate the redness so much. T\_T"
1593377003.0,6,"Personally for me, once I am able to control the oiliness of my skin, get rid of texture, and most of my acne marks is when I will be able to feel I have reached my “perfect/good skin condition”. I wouldn’t mind getting tiny breakouts here and there because I have come to the realization that I will never have perfect glass type skin. And that’s okay. Everyone deals with skin issues here and there and being a girl who currently has acne and has dealt with it for quite a while, I will be truly grateful once my skin reaches my current goal I have. 

Anyone reading this, just know you are beautiful with or without acne. NO ONE is perfect. And you shouldn’t feel horrible about yourself if you aren’t able to achieve the type of skin that is often portrayed on social media. 

Just keep up with a good skin care routine and have faith. Trust the process and know that YOU ARE ENOUGH!!"

1593369279.0,4,"Every once in a while, my skin feels plump, moisturized, and perfectly smooth all over. I usually have small patches of eczema or small bumps along my cheeks, so texture is the most important indicator that my routine is working. It might have some redness or hyperpigmentation, but when the texture is good I consider it perfect."

1593373863.0,3,"My main skin issue has always extremely dry skin and eczema. It totally blighted my childhood/teenage years. Now I'm in my 40s and have mostly healthy skin, thank god. Dry skin = sensitive skin to me, so as long as it's well moisturised and calm, I'm happy. I can deal with dark circles, hyperpigmentation scars and blemishes (I have a LOT), with makeup, and I don't sweat the small stuff like the odd pimple. I have a routine and I stick to it and  know what types of products to avoid and what will suit me. 

Not every product is for me and I'm OK with that, in fact having sensitive skin saves me money! 😂😂"
1593379716.0,3,"I don't have social media as in Instagram etc as I find that it can often skew reality and expectations. I've seen a lot of posts from people that struggle with perfectionism to do with skin. I struggled myself at one point as I was constantly looking for faults to 'fix'. 
I often think that being interested in skin care can be both a blessing and a curse. Once you start to gain knowledge, it can sometimes lead to finding faults with your appearance and finding new products so it can feel like a never ending battle. 
What helped me was stepping back and really understanding my skin. I also think it's important to take care of yoir skin but still live your life at the same time.
I think that once you understand your own skin and not compare it to anyone else's can help."

1593376389.0,2,"19 year old woman here! 

When my skin's only texture is ""baby like"". Sadly due to years of self-abuse, I have destroyed any semblance of small pores on my t-zone and I live with the consequences. I may always look like I have freckles but as long as it's flat (where I might cover with makeup or just at least feel the smoothness), I'm fine. If my skin is dewy in the mornings, that's a bonus. I really wish my skin were like an idol's/actress's, but I like to remind myself that their cameras nowadays have built in filters so we will never truly see how bad they do/don't suffer. 

Of course it took me years to get here. Back in the day, my goal was to have no zits. Nowadays I think my goal is to soften my hyperpigmentation (which of course comes at random in the form of a massive painful harbinger zit which I refuse to manhandle) and ""empty"" my SFs on my T zone/clear out some gunk in there. 

Wishing you both patience and good health!"
1593377698.0,2,"I feel so defeated in my skin care journey that I would be ecstatic if I could just have no blemishes (pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, milia) but food sensitivities and autoimmune problems mean that'll probably never happen.

Good skin for me is properly hydrated with no acne (or at least maybe one small spot at worst), which I’ve thankfully achieved. Perfect would be also getting rid of my minor scarring and redness, the former of which can hopefully disappear soon— not sure about the redness though."

After spending some years now consuming more content about the process than the end result, I can confidently walk down a street any day and know that if I see people with better skin than me they either have makeup on, can afford treatments I can’t, or there’s just a genetic factor involved that I can do nothing to change and so why bother thinking about. I think mostly you have to learn how to minimise the amount that you compare yourself to others physically because it only leads to unhappiness and insecurity or thinking/talking badly about others purely due to looks - focus more on the journey of doing what’s healthy for your skin and coming to first accept, then love the skin you have and making it work for you."

1593394374.0,1,"right now, my idea of good skin is similar to a more realistic version of glass skin. i still have some scarring and blackheads as well as hormonal acne on my chin. i’m not expecting perfect skin because i know my skin has been through worse. 

i find it so satisfying when i have clear skin on my cheeks and the light bounces off my cheekbones to make my skin look dewy and clear even when it’s not."

I feel like I’ve been generally happy with my skin lately, but I think a ~mindset shift really came from a post a few weeks ago, a ‘base make up for kdrama stars’ video? and someone commented that the post really helped her see that even tv actors don’t have perfect skin, and I think someone in the same post mentioned that they’ve stopped striving for perfect skin, but rather just happy skin :)"

1593396257.0,1,"I have eczema so for me, perfect facial skin should be hydrated and glowy with smooth texture. No redness or dry patches or bumps. I am okay with somewhat uneven skin tone or things like black dots on the nose since I’m most concerned about the inflammation of my skin. For me, healthy skin is beautiful skin, even if it’s not perfect."
1593396665.0,1,"Well-hydrated skin with little to no acne scars. No acne scars would be perfect obviously, but I've haven't had clear skin in so long that I've just sort've come to terms with having a few acne scars here and there.

For the longest time, I hated the texture on my cheeks because I would see celebrities with *super* smooth skin with literally no pores. I tried everything to achieve that poreless look, but I now realize that celebrities get all these expensive treatments done, plus there's almost always some type of makeup, editing, lighting, etc. at play. It's just not realistic for me to try and achieve a face that looks like that irl. All I can really do right now is reduce the appearance of my textured skin with makeup or editing photos or something, but idk I care enough to edit my photos like that or start wearing makeup every day again lol

I no longer expect my skin to be flawless. I just want my skin clear enough to the point where I look nice with minimal or no makeup."
1593396940.0,1,"I like having oily skin because it makes me look youthful and hydrated. I hate dry skin because it gets flaky and sometimes it hurts and it can also cause pimples. I mostly struggle with dry skin and just use some gentle soap and moisturizer. Pimples will be there depending on where I am in my cycle, but it becomes a problem when they appear for an extended period of time, especially on a certain place on my face because it means one of my new products is causing me to have break-outs. Recently, it's been my new flavor of toothpaste that caused breakouts on my chin.

I think oiliness and even a little redness is fine as well as small pimples. But when it becomes painful and your pimples are developing a lot of pus and bleeding a lot and your face is flaking as well and it's red and itchy a lot of the time, you really need to get that checked on. I had allergies to my meds once and it did ALL of that. 

What a perfect skin is what is comfortable for you. I need to moisturize my skin, so I don't get itchy because that is hella uncomfortable for me. I don't get pimples that often because of genetics unless I'm at that point in my cycle, but if I do get pimples, I can just cover them with makeup. I just want skin that is neither itchy or painful."
1593399758.0,1,"Honestly as of now and for me personally, just to be hydrated and clear of acne and PIH is good enough for me. Maybe in the future I'll invest into microdermabrasion because over the counter products and retin A can only do so much."

I would feel so much better about the skin on my face if I could just reverse all the damage I’ve caused. However, I’ll always be at war with my skin in general. I was recently diagnosed with a disfiguring and painful skin disease that I’ll be battling all of my life. Thankfully it doesn’t affect the skin on my face, but it’s caused me to become even more laser-focused on every inch of skin covering my body, and I’m really struggling with the knowledge that I’ll never have good skin. I’ll have to get regular injections of a drug that will destroy my immune system, and use antiseptic wound wash instead of shower gel every day. If that doesn’t work, I’ll probably have to get some very painful and invasive surgery that most likely won’t even be very effective. All this just to keep me from looking like I have the bubonic plague. I’ve been at war with my skin since I first started getting acne at age 10, and I don’t think it’s ever going to end. I’m exhausted."
1593403880.0,1,"When I have no pimples and my skin is hydrated and plump is how I settle that my skin is in god condition. I gave up worrying about how large my pores look and instead, maintaining my skin so that it does not enlarge."
1593405580.0,1,For me it's no visible large pores. Ones that you can see from a mirror standing several feet away. It's incredibly annoying and makes skin look rough and old. I remember a study that came out years ago that said it wasn't wrinkles that age someone but overall texture of someone's skin. I get acne but even that pales in comparison to a orange peel skin.

1593407426.0,1,"My experience with hormonal acne when I was 20 (currently 24 now) resulted in me having skin dysmorphia and with that lots anxiety and shame about my skin. It was hard to overcome but it was discipline and many years of building up my skincare to maintain a routine and heal scars. I realise I will never have perfect skin because of genetics but I am satisfied that it’s healthy: not dry with minimal closed comedones and under the skin pimples. With time, my scarring has gotten lighter - up close you can see some pores from picking or deep pimples. 

The following I’ve come to accept are totally normal: some scarring, some redness on my cheeks, discolouration from eye bags, skin that isn’t perfectly smooth and has some texture."
1593412164.0,1,"For me it’s just keeping my skin clean. I have a medium oily type of skin and when I was a teenager I didn’t take good care of myself, even with the things I usually ate or didn’t ate.

I wash my face with warm water (more cold than warm... I don’t know how to explain it) in the morning and put on my face cream. 

Normally I wash my face again at night.

Also once two weeks or so I like to rub an ice cube on my face when I wash my face at night.

Important thing I don’t do, I don’t dry my skin with any kind of cloth, I just dry the little drops on my neck and that’s it; when it’s almost dry I put on my face cream and I’m all ready. But this is a personal thing, I guess.

I don’t care getting pimples because at least once a month they come to visit, so I welcome them and go ahead with my life.

Another thing it’s that I love make up but I almost don’t wear any, on a daily basis I only do my eye shadow and eyebrows and wear sunblock. If I have a special ocasión I do my makeup fully.

And drinking water it’s a must and normal advice. But I guess that in conclusion, getting to know your own skin it’s the key. What kind of face mask work for you, what kind of pimples you get and where, and that it doesn’t get dry.

Your skin it’s your perfect skin, of course you need to take care of her. When you notice something out of the normal, (because hormones can get wild) then take note and if it something current reach for help.

I hope this kinda helped, and that you are good, happy and healthy"

Bright is relating to the texture and sheen of the skin - bright vs dull. To get brighter, you can hydrate, exfoliate, peel, condition, etc."

1593451161.0,-2,Bright/white/lighten is the same thing!!!! It’s all inhibiting melanin production to have “brighter/glowy” skin

In other words, it's the distance of your bathroom counter or how far a close friend would stand! If that's the closest most of the world will see your skin, then why worry about anything more subtle? 


Side notes:

Getting up close to your face, or anyone's face for that matter, will reveal countless imperfections. For me, that encourages picking, and it's unhealthy both mentally and for my skin.

Even if you do get very close to a friend's face, I think we are likely to be more forgiving about their skin vs our own. You may see very similar imperfections on someone else but judge yourself more harshly. We are our own worst critic - I think evaluating ourselves with kindness is very important."
1593443694.0,3,"I get pretty close to my mirror too, with a white light. ""Bad"" skin condition is really dependent on the person, just like all other aspects of our body like weight and fashion. I mean, it's not good to only look at the little flaws and imperfect points of your skin because ""perfect"" doesn't really exist. But I don't see a problem getting up close so I can adjust my skin routine to follow my skins problems. Like even if my friends don't see dry skin on my face, I can feel it is dryer than it was last week and can adjust my routine to add more hyraluronic acids and masks. 

This is a tough question since it sounds like a state of mind. If the little imperfections really bug you to the point that it hurts your self esteem, lean back a bit. But it's tough if you already have the mindset that your skin is ""bad"". I would say practice some positive enforcement. Some texture, dry areas, breakouts don't particularly mean bad skin. Everytime you lean in and see an imperfections, counter it with a positive. ""oh, there's some discoloration/redness here, BUT my skin is more moisturized this week from last week!"""
1593455337.0,4,"For me it’s about 30cm. Even though people are frequently closer to my face than that, when my skin looks good at that distance then I’m happy with it. When I get too close or use a super magnifying mirror I end up picking my face, small innocuous bumps or ccs that are unnoticeable >30cm. I make them so much worse and visible from a distance. 

I don’t think getting closer than that is healthy, especially for me and my obsessive tendencies."

I just ordered from YESSTYLE and received a confirmation list of what I ordered.

Yet when I check my order history on their site, they replaced 4x of the five pack (item A) with SINGLE packs (item B).


What I ordered (even email confirmation says this):

1. 5x item A (5PCS in each)


What it says in order history:

1. 1x item A (5PCS in each)

2. 5x item B (1PC in each) same product but only piece in each. I NEVER ORDERED THIS ONE.

I sent them a message detailing the catalog numbers and everything relevant.

Now I'm worried I'm gonna be shipped incorrect items and charged full price close to $100.


Questions:

1. How does this happen? 
2. Where did ITEM B even come from when it was never in the order?
3. Item A is still listed as available on their website, so stock shouldn't be an issue?
4. Has this happened to anyone else?"

* allantoin is listed separately as an ""active ingredient"" on ratzilla (and on [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/curel-intensive-moisture-cream)), whereas on ulta (and on the brand site) it's listed as part of the ingredients list. i see on yesstyle that allantoin is the first ingredient, but i would guess the person who wrote the ingredients on there might have just copy and pasted it
* the order of ingredients after PEG-3 Dimethicone are different on the ulta site vs on ratzilla. imo if there's only 0.5% allantoin, i would imagine it's not a big deal and may just have to do with regulations on how ingredients under 1% are listed

that being said, i've never ordered the moisturizer off of yesstyle of amazin japan or anything so i can't say for sure if they're different or the same. i do think the moisturizer i purchased from ulta works very well. and really, what i'm interested in are the pseudoceramides (Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide), and that's the 3rd ingredient on all the listings"
1593416324.0,5,It won’t do anything particularly harmful to your skin. Certain SPF ingredients might clog pores so just monitor your skin and see how it reacts.

For her skincare routine, we both use a rejuvenating set for about 2 months. It really whitened our skin and we didn't get pimples but I think it's too harsh. Our face is really white so we stopped it. So as of today, her skincare routine is just a soap, safeguard soap specifically.

It could be the weather although I believe the climate there is still a bit humid right? So it wouldn’t affect much. Maybe your skin needs a bit more moisture and then you could try to add the HA so it doesn’t burn or make your skin itch."

I cant really tell from the picture since it's just of her forehead. If her face is so dry that it is flaky I would focus of keeping the skin hydrated. A lot of time skin that is lacking moisture will produce more oil in order to keep itself hydrated. This could be why her skin feels oily. Once she has had a basic routine down, she can start looking at things she can add to help with the acne. But this can take time because adding too many changes at once and overload the skin and cause more acne."

And yeah the first time I applied the HL it was after the Innisfree green tea serum so it felt alright but the next time I tried it right after cleansing things started going south 😂. 
But I might pause on that while trying out gentler products and repair my skin. Worst comes I will use HL on my body, my hands feel so nice and soft after applying!

It's possible that they can't make a stable sunscreen formula if they need to add 5% or 10% niacinamide into the formulation. If you're already using a well formulated Niacinamide serum, that would be enough.


Innisfree Triple Care Sunscreen contains Niacinamide."
1593531772.0,2,"Both the non-AB popular suncreen LaRoche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Moisturizer UV (SPF30) and EltaMD UV Clear SPF46 has niacinamide in it, both broke me out (EltaMD mildly, and LRP extremely bad) so I'm convinced my skin doesn't like niacinamide. EltaMD has 5% niacinamide, which is pretty decent concentration, LRP has lower concentration I think (don't quote me), so you might want to try them if you like.  

I'm not aware of any AB sunscreen that has niacinamide, but others feel free to correct me.   

Agree with the other user that if you should look for separate products though!   

Good luck!"

This is a relatively common experience for people living in dry climates when using HA, so if this applies to you it may be that HA alone is not the best humectant for you.

Also, as another user pointed out, the hada labo is meant to be followed up by a moisturizer. If you're putting it on as the last step or not sealing it with a moisturizer, then the water will evaporate & leave you feeling dry. The best way (imo) to use the hada labo lotion & other humectants is to apply onto a damp face and seal it in with a moisturizer to prevent water loss from the skin."

Shipping usually takes a little bit but I ordered by them a number of times, it always came and I heard their customer service is not too bad! They have a big variety of things and the prices seem fair. What I like most here is that the prices are already converted, I live in the UK and prices are in pounds for me. A lot of other sites sell in USD only and that always leaves an extra charge on my card. No custom issues with them either.

Wishtrend is not a bad choice either, especially if you follow some skincare YouTubers, they often do deals with the website where you can get a multitude of products for up to 50% off in selected boxes (James Welsh did one in the past, so did KennieJD). Prices seem to be in USD though - so you might get charged for foreign currency."

Since the free shipping options from eBay sellers from Korea and Japan are currently not available, and me and my sister were in need of various things, I went ahead and split it up in two orders - one from RoseRoseShop and the other from YesStyle. 
The RoseRoseShop order came within a stunning under 3 weeks time and even though the shipping costs by weight are added at the end, prices were still cheap. My YesStyle orders in the past were also super fast and without problems. The only reason I haven't received my current one is because items needed to be request ordered and that took 3 weeks - which I knew beforehand. Also customs (German customs duties) were never an issue and I have never had to pay fees for my skincare packages (RRS do declare the value 20€ on default I think)."

I've also bought from skintrick.si before, not during these times however.

I've also considered iherb, an american website, where the shipping isn't that expensive. However, you do have to be careful with getting hit with an extra customs fee for orders over 22€ (i think).

1593405389.0,10,"For me it's more about taking things out of my routine. I've been avoiding putting retinol or benzoyl peroxide in the ""mask area"" since it makes the irritation worse, and I'm not wearing makeup. I'm being very careful about how much I exfoliate. Most spot treatments are drying, which is *not* what my extra-irritated rosacea wants rn, so I try to use it sparingly. 

I have been more diligent about applying moisturizer/aloe to (attempt) to form a barrier between my skin and the mask. Once my face gets sweaty under the mask, I'll wipe my skin gently with an antibacterial wipe, then switch out the previous mask for a fresh one. So I end up going through ~3 cotton masks on a full day and handwash them with fragrance free detergent every night.

1593442357.0,7,"I haven't personally tried wishtrend's vitamin C but it looks promising based on ingredients!

However, some recs for large pores & textured skin include:

* **Krave kale-lalu-yAHA** (has 5.25% glycolic acid & betaine salicylate which are exfoliating ingredients that help with pores, texture & breakouts. Other good exfoliating recs include Paula's choice 2% BHA liquid & stratia soft touch AHA)
* **Niacinamide** (helps with pores & sebum-regulation, skin-barrier maintenance, redness, breakouts - the ordinary, the inkey list, paula's choice, & 2sol all have 10% niacinamide serums. Niacinamide is also a popular ingredient in moisturizers: Purito deep sea water cream & cosrx rice overnight spa mask both have 2% niacinamide.
* **Green tea/Matcha/EGCG** (can help reduce the appearance of pores. Some suggestions: krave beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser, krave beauty beet the sun/the beet shield, peach & lily matcha pudding antioxidant cream, the etude house soon jung line is all formulated with green tea extract & are targeted towards sensitive, acne prone skin - also there are tons of ab green tea based toners & serums)
* **Hydration** (in my personal experience, I have the most texture when my skin is dehydrated so keeping skin hydrated & not dried out may also help with texture)"
1593469407.0,1,"I have tried out wishtrend 21.5 vitamin c sheet masks. And they are pretty good. The vitamin c here is naturally derived and even though I have very very sensitive skin, it didn't irritate me at all. 
The klairs vitamin c on the other hand broke me out terribly and made me dry out too.
Wishtrend vitamin c serum is very high in ascorbic acid containing 21.5%. be careful of vitamin c with this high percentage cause it's very potent. I have seen reviews about people saying that it caused tingling and burning sensation a lot. So haven't tried it out yet. If it fails, you can try out 'purito vitamin c serum', it contains 10% ascorbic acid which is quite decent too for a vitamin c serum. Hope this helps.
 So good luck to you!"
1593476737.0,1,It has been my absolute favorite. I like it better than the SkinCeuticals and it's a fraction of the price. A few weeks after I started using it people started commenting on how healthy my skin looked.
1593516008.0,1,"i like it and find it exactly the same as the TImeless vitamin C which i also like. however, i can't use it everyday else it will make my face goes red.  i use it once every 3days."
1593697768.0,1,"yes butttt, i remember the formula from a long time ago and it was much better. At that time I was using the serum and the sheet masks every single day and i was able to tell a significant. i mean significant difference. in 2019, i ordered them again, twice. the serum and the sheet masks. im pretty sure the formula and the packaging changed for both as well. for some reason i wasn't noticing the same results like i had back then. For the mask, the actual type of sheet changed as well.Im sure it's still good, but okay level? not as great as it used to be. My serums have expired but now im stuck with like 20+ vit c sheets i got when it was on BOGOF. i'll probably gift them."
1593809167.0,1,"Wishtrend's Pure Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum was actually the second vitamin C serum that I got my hands on when I first got deeply into skincare. I have oily and acne-prone skin, so I primarily wanted the Vitamin C serum to reduce my acne hyperpigmentation. For me, it worked really well for that (I used three drops - forehead and both cheeks - twice a day) since it's quite concentrated. I would recommend the Wishtrend's vitamin C serum for reducing hyperpigmentation.

That being said, if your skin is a bit sensitive, try looking into Wishtrend's **Pure Vitamin C 15% with Ferulic Acid** which is less concentrated than the Pure Vitamin C 21.5% serum. Good luck!

As a side note, I've also used the Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop and it was definitely much slower to give me the results I wanted because of the lower concentration (from what I could tell)."

1593456345.0,5,"Trouble is, there's a million causes for dark circles so there's no miracle cream that addresses all of them. Blood pooling, hyperpigmentation, poor circulation, sinus issues, poor sleep, poor hydration, thin skin, autoimmune or thyroid conditions, fat prolapse (eg festoons) due to weak muscles, or even just the way your skull is shaped.


I've had dark circles since I was a young child, I think I've got concave tear trough deformity with my orbital socket. Yeah sleeping poorly makes it worse, but amazing sleep and hydration doesn't get rid of them. Just under the threshold for hyperthyroidism, but not clinically significant. Caffeine serums don't help, moisturizers don't help. Getting enough sun every day (at least, not spending all day staring at a screen) seems to improve them marginally. But they'll never go away in my case.



Give caffeine serums a try, they work for SOME people; Dr Jart and The Ordinary have some. If one doesn't work, don't bother with any other caffeine stuff."

that said, the under eye area is tricky and there's a number of different factors that can create the appearance of dark circles so perhaps worth trying if you have it on hand. one of my HG products for the rest of the face though, i absolutely love it 😊"

1593311036.0,98,"I think any hydrating toner will be great in helping to mitigate the oily skin (drying out your skin can produce more oils and leads to more acne) and I find that having hydrated skin really helps with hyperpigmentation and scarring.

Some good toners are: klairs unscented preparation facial toner, pyunkang yul essence toner (loveeee this one I can’t rave about it enough) and the ever so popular hado labo lotions!!"
1593312822.0,29,"Omg are we skin twins? I found that HL premium is the best toner ever!
I started using skinlex 10% niacinamide serum two days ago and I've NEVER looked back! Usually I wake up and my face is an oily mess, but I woke up today and HOLY CRAP when I touched my face, no excess oil came off! This is the HG of HGs! Plus, my PIH has started fading a lot faster!"

1593326132.0,5,klairs unscented toner!! is fungal acne safe and leaves your skin feeling much hydrated.
1593326468.0,5,The I'm from rice toner would be perfect for you! It doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky and is great for fading hyperpigmentation
1593327028.0,6,"My skin's pretty similar and I'm currently loving the Kikumasamune High Moist, with an added layer of Mamonde Rose Water if I need the extra hydration. If it's only the BHA you don't like, though, the COSRX AHA is my failsafe when I'm breaking out even though the BHA was pretty awful for me.

And if you'd like to incorporate propolis into your routine like someone else suggested, the Skin Food Propolis Essence was pretty great for the first two bottles, though it sort of stopped working overnight for me and I don't know if my skin just got used to it or what. But it helped regulate oil production and left my skin neither matte nor greasy but just sort of glowy and bright, I miss it."

1593313629.0,1,Oo yes that is some really drying soap. I love black soap combo with Shea butter on the body but shea butter too thick for summer so I only employ black soap in winter.
1593349710.0,1,Um what?
1593350005.0,1,This isn’t even the topic of conversation so if you want something... like that. Go somewhere else :)
1593312044.0,5,so glad to hear it!! It’s an absolute HG for me as well!! I definitely will be looking into trying some of their other products haha
1593345434.0,1,"I think I might go w that one then but my prob is I heard about instree/innisfree and idk which ones best for scarring, hyperpigmentation, oily skin, and fungal acne. (Plus my skin on my face is much darker than the rest of my body)"
1593372687.0,1,So did the hyperpigmentation die down?
1593327406.0,2,that’s so unfortunate!! Sad to hear that it didn’t work out :((
1593463306.0,2,"the same thing happened to me, I have oily/combination skin as well. I found it to gave me white heads and my skin just looked blotchy after using it, super disappoint since now I have a whole bottle I don’t know what to do with."
1593327340.0,12,"haha ofc, I use it both am (right after cleansing and before moisturizer/spf) and pm (after tret, then pyunkang, then moisturizer). I always apply it to a slightly damp face in layers. The first layer I just put 1-2 drops of the slightly viscous formula and pat it gently into my face. I repeat 2-3 times depending on how much moisture I need at the time. I have combo skin with an oily, acne prone t-zone and cheeks with dry patches. Since I’m also on tret, this toner helped hydrate my skin barrier when it was compromised. My skin was red, stinging like crazy when anything was applied and I got random blotches of red on my skin after washing my face. This toner has a slightly viscous texture and absorbs well into my skin without feeling heavy. It definitely can be used for the “7 skins” method! In addition, the product is from the pyunkang oriental medicine clinic in south korea and they emphasize using basic, simple no fuss ingredients based on traditional medicine. The essence toner only has 7 ingredients and I believe like 91.3 of it is like milk vetch (astragalus root) extract which has foundations in traditional Chinese medicine and is known for soothing skin, warming up skin circulation and reducing irritation/redness. but ofc as always ymmv!! Hope this helped :))"
1593340611.0,2,"HL stands for Hada Labo, theyre a fantastic brand.
Yes, this toner is thick and serumy, it's very hydration based and plumping. I use the skinlex one for the niacinamide and I like to mix the two to dilute it sometimes. I use them both though, and they're hg"
1593346317.0,1,Do they have it on Amazon in your area? I think hada Labo products there are reputable
1593352785.0,1,"Yeah, the serum has glucosamine so it boosts the effect of niacinamide. It also has licorice extract.
Both do the job ig, but I wish skinlex were could ship to more places too :(("
1593313791.0,8,The light version has Polysorbate 20 which is supposedly not FA safe.
1593353971.0,1,Ohh thanks for pointing that out. I didn't realise cause it didn't trigger fungal acne for me
1593409973.0,2,"Oh crap, I didn't know! It's never exacerbated mine, but of course YMMV. Thanks for the heads up!"
1593376188.0,1,"Just out of curiosity, why is it not FA safe?"
1593350275.0,1,"That's strange, I have very oily skin and haven't found it to be sticky or foaming in the slightest. Not something i've seen on reviews I've scoured before purchasing either but YMMV"
1593338395.0,1,"Well yes, but why? Too irritating? Too mild? Doesn't like the consistency/ application? Etc"
1593375361.0,1,Ah didn’t know! Thank you!
1593348136.0,1,"I haven't tried the Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner personally, but have heard good things. I use the Green Tea toner in the morning and the EH Relief Toner at night but I don't think it makes too much difference. I've just bought the COSRX Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream. It's pretty hard finding a good moisturiser for oily acne prone skin!"
1593373528.0,1,I can't say for sure because I use other brightening products in conjunction for better effects.  I have a synergistic effect of several products to be the most effective for me.
1593423447.0,1,"Well I have consistent acne that I'm trying to fix (hormones can be brutal), so I still get new spots, but they definitely seem to go away faster than they have before."
1593345506.0,1,Would u suggest for me to get tret? And if I’m going to incorporate serums like niacinamide would that go after the toner or before?
1593341585.0,3,Just to clarify - is the HL premium toner the one in the yellow bottle? Thank you :)
1593346359.0,2,Yea there’s amazon in my area but I don’t use amazon.com I use amazon.ae and they rlly do up the price
1593371546.0,2,Thanks! I had no idea.
1593354459.0,1,"It doesn't for everyone, it's one of those ingredients for people with high sensitivity. Really sad though because it really is an amazing product otherwise :) !"
1593440959.0,2,The Kiku contains ferments which can trigger a fungal acne outbreak.
1593775494.0,2,"For Mamonde, it has hydrogenated castor oil on its INCI list which some species of the FA causing yeasts feed on."
1593350543.0,1,Yeah I bought the actual authentic one from the store itself but for some reason niacinamide and the étude house had the habit of foaming on my face
1593349679.0,1,Yeah I’m considering to buy the cerave moisturizing lotion
1593359995.0,2,"what are your skin problems? Tret is like the gold standard-it can help with acne, hyperpigmentation, anti-aging, smoothing our texture, cell regeneration etc (but make sure to wear spf during the day as it makes it your skin more sensitive). Niacinamide is supposed to help with reducing sebum production (less oils, hyperpigmentation, less redness and acne. Both is good, but if you want to start out with something that is slightly lighter (tret usage may be accompanied with a purge and takes longer to see the  effects), I would suggest applying niacinamide after cleansing and toner but before moisturizer (so cleanse, toner/essence, niacinamide, moisturizer). For tretinoin you are supposed to buffer so after cleansing wait 10-15 minutes for your face to dry, then put on tret and hang out for like 30 minutes, then wet face with damp hands and put on the rest of your routine. By the way, putting toner/essence on a slightly damp face really helps lock in the moisture into your skin barrier much better than if you were to put it on dry skin"
1593342329.0,2,Yep! The yellow orange gradient!
1593812232.0,1,Thank you all for responding! My little sister has FA and I wanted to know which products she should avoid
1593355446.0,1,Are you using TO niacinamide? I use the soonjung toner with PC 10% niacinamide and no roaming issues.
1593355672.0,1,Becareful with this moisturizer. I recently bought it and thought it would be better bang for my buck but my gosh I instantly felt a flush and itchy feeling. I ignored it and went along my day but the slight flush and once a while itchiness lasted on and off all day until I washed it off. And the following day I got 4 juicy cyst. Stopped using it and haven’t broken out since.
1593362943.0,2,"My skins problems are fungal acne, hyperpigmentation, and scarring. I’ll keep what u said in mind"
1593355797.0,1,Yeah I’m using TO
1593355816.0,1,I think it’s the way im applying it
1593355777.0,1,Any suggestions for what moisturizer I could get?
1593363998.0,1,not ab product but I heard the ordinary niacinamide serum is fungal acne safe!
1593356274.0,1,Yeah using TO niacinamide foams if you don’t want for in between steps to absorb. I would still try the soonjung toner because it has really good soothing ingredients.
1593355933.0,1,I’ve been using cerave pm (old formula) and just ordered the new formula hopefully it won’t break me out. But I’ve been testing vanicream lite lotion. And my skin has not reacted negatively to it so far. I’m still in the process of patch testing. I’m hoping it doesn’t break me out because it actually absorbs really nicely into the skin.
1593366370.0,1,Heard great things about COSRX Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream but waiting for mine to arrive .
1593356597.0,1,Yeah but the soonjung foamed too
1593358641.0,11,"I have combination, dehydrated and sensitive skin and have found centella products help a lot with redness. For now I'm using the Benton Goodbye Redness Centella Gel under sunscreen during the day and under another moisturiser at night."
1593364504.0,8,"Have you tried any urea moisturizer? I used to layer moisturizer but since I added urea, my skin is more hydrated and less dry."
1593364108.0,4,"I’ve been mainly layering essences/toners bc I find layering on the moisturizers on my oily probe skin makes it more oily and just feels heavy/sticky, but I don’t mind using a heavier moisturizer at night"
1593378825.0,4,"Dr. Jart has been a lifesaver for me. I layer the Ceramidin liquid, then the Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream. If I'm just staying in for the day (which has been practically every day for months on end at this point) then I layer the Ceramidin liquid with the Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment. My redness has gone down so much that I will Zoom with only the Color Correcting Treatment on and no makeup! My skin has never looked so healthy."
1593401762.0,2,I switched my toner and moisturiser to Commleaf Skin Relief (Centella asiatica concentration) when I was experiencing unusual redness and dehydration a couple of weeks ago and it’s been great since. Redness went down in a jiffy and I didn’t need to layer the moisture even when I apply my retinol cream.
1593426801.0,2,I have the same skin-type as you and my recent revelation in redness reduction is mugwort although I also use Purito's unscented (the scented version made my redness worse) centella buffet serum. Loving Missha's artesmia essence and I'm From's mugwort mask.
1593381421.0,1,"I used to use banila co purity, but I switched to hada labo oil cleanser. It's cheaper and works well"
1593359120.0,7,"Yes, cica is amazing! I would also throw the [Purito Centella Unscented Serum](https://m.puritoen.com/product/purito-centella-unscented-serum/57/) and [Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Serum](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/keep-cool-soothe-bamboo-serum-50ml/1556066839/) as recommendations to check out.

OP, like you, I am layering the LRP Cicaplast at night. I usually put on 3 separate layers spaced out by 30 minute intervals and add a few drops of rosehip oil at the end to seal the deal. It’s probably overkill (and my face is completely white by then) but I wake up with skin that is no longer irritated.

Also, I don’t know where you live, but I’m in a sunny area and I’m religious about reapplying sunscreen every 2 hours. (Again, it might be overkill, but I’m on tret so I get burned easily.)"
1593415969.0,1,How do you like the gel? I've been considering buying it for a while now. Does it sink in quickly?
1593371088.0,1,Which one are you using?
1593425584.0,1,"No I haven't actually, I was going to ask which one do you use but I can see your suggestions below. Thank you! I'm going to research them a bit further"
1593391546.0,1,this is what i do + skin aqua moisture milk sunscreen.
1593425794.0,1,"I would love to try out Dr jart, but if I remember correctly it had either alcohol or fragrance in the products when I was researching them a while back, which are major triggers for me. But I have heard such good thing about them! If only they did a version suitable for sensitive skin, a girl can hope!"
1593425976.0,1,"Oooo interesting I've never heard of this, I will look into it. I'm so glad you've had relief though, I hope it keeps working out for you ❤"
1593427073.0,1,"I actually have a tester for the mugworts mask and the honey mask from the I'm From's line that has been sitting in my draw for a while. I never actually considered trying it. What benefits do you see from it? Though for our skin type, anything that doesn't irritate is an instant win 😅

And don't worry my skin hates anything with fragrance too, if only brands would do more unscented lines!"
1593425888.0,1,"I'll look into it, thank you. Did you experience any irritation with the Banila co one?"
1593425501.0,1,"Im so glad you've mentioned the Purito brand I'm considering getting their sunscreen as i'm starting to run out of my Klairs UV Essence Sunscreen. I will take a look at both of the serums too, I love cica products, but my skin absolutely hates trying anything new.

Which rosehip oil do you use? I really want to introduce an oil but I'm not sure which one to try. I tested the PAI rosehip oil last year and my skin absolutely freaked out! This brand is supposedly designed for sensitive / red skin as well."
1593416351.0,2,"It's very soothing and lightweight - almost like a thick serum. It does leave a very thin ""film"" on my skin, but I always use another product on top of it so it's not really an issue for me."

1593457982.0,2,My redness is way less noticeable after using those two mugwort products although I find the Missha essence isn't very hydrating so still need to use a hydrating toner/essence as well. YMMV of course: I've tried so many redness reducing products as I'm so self-conscious about it but mostly been left disappointed.
1593437637.0,1,"Yeah, it ended up making my face very red after using it for a while"
1593441182.0,2,"I’ve used the Purito sunscreen; it gets rave reviews here but it’s kind of just okay for me. It feels like a lotion when applied but it is not waterproof, so don’t apply it anywhere near your eyes! The Innisfree Daily Defense is a good alternative as it also has centella.

For rosehip oil, I’ve always used TO bc it’s cheap and I can get it easily from Sephora. I’ve used it for years with no problem (just 2-3 drops at the end of the PM routine). Some people do experience reactions though. You may be able to try another oil that your skin accepts, such as jojoba. YMMV!"
1593372057.0,1,Thank you
1593404610.0,14,I use a fragrance free routine on my face but not completely on my body or hair. my makeup is not explicitly fragrance free but mostly unscented. I do not wear makeup often though. I don’t think fragrance is terrible I’m just trying to reduce potential irritants to keep my skin as safe as possible and it also helps me rule out problem ingredients in new products.

1593345891.0,2,"Ughhhhh how I wish I got one of the flowfushi eyeliners whole I was in Japan!! I tested them out on my hand and they hardly budged. But because I'm still trying to get through my EM Cosmetics liquid eyeliner, I didn't (not a fan of that one tbh but I wanted to use it up). Regretting that now!"
1593362223.0,2,"Seconding this! I have these liners in black, dark brown, light brown and gray. They used to be called moteliner, but now are branded as uzu liners.

The gray liner is really good, especially on minimal makeup days such as beach days. I usually just apply SPF, pat on a bit of loose powder to hide the shine from the sunscreen and swipe the gray liner on to give depth to the eyes and I'm good.

Also, for people with shakey hands like mine, they don't leave the blob of liner like some other brands."
1593325210.0,1,"While I agree on this, I have to say that I hate how much the brush frays? I never had brush fraying on me like that."

1593327663.0,1,"i used this! and it’s great, no smudging"
1593443640.0,1,So so so good! A client gave me one to try and I haven’t stopped using it. I live in a very hot and humid climate and it stays on throughout the day. No smudging.
1593328684.0,1,I own the dark brown version and I love it but I’m not a fan of the sparkles.. do all the colors have that?
1593332480.0,2,"This! This is my baby! I get raccoon eyes with every other eyeliner I tried until this one and honestly I have zero desire to try anything else (it it ain't broke). It's SO reliable. I've been through rain, sauna, hot tub, and long work days and I've never been disappointed. The only thing that makes the eyeliner come off is if I rub my eyes."
1593340476.0,1,"Have you tried using it with a primer? I was the same (monolid eyes, go figure) but now I use the HG combo of Nars eye primer + Heroine (or K-Palette) pen eyeliner and I get no smudging or wearing. It’s taken years of raccoon eyes to get here...!!"
1593434312.0,1,Not AB but have you tried the Stila one? That one has a lot of staying power.
1593319893.0,2,What is UZ?
1593336109.0,1,"Totally agree with not too soft or hard. It's very fluid and does most of the work for you :) If it helps, I just pull out the frayed hairs with a pair of tweezers :)"

I am in Ireland and have ordered from them at least three times, they usually route through the Jersey Islands and I have never had to pay customs.  If you do have to pay customs they will reimburse you in store credit.  I haven't ordered during the pandemic so I expect it would be very slow but I would still recommend them!  EU based sources for anything Asian Beauty put the highest markup on, I can't stomach paying them knowing I can order directly!"
1593448711.0,2,"Hi, I’m from Germany too and just wanna let you know that you don’t have to worry too much about customs!

I’ve had 4 orders delivered from yesstyle during the pandemic; 2 around 50€, 2 around 80€. NONE of it got stuck in customs! 

Yesstyle writes something like “scarf, value 16€” (was actually 2 shirts and 4 lipsticks) for small packages and “shoes, value 18€” (was actually 5 shirts, 4 lipsticks and a primer) for bigger packages. Basically they undervalue it so you won’t have to come in and open it for customs bcs it’s over the 22€ limit. 

Just don’t buy like 30 items at once so the package doesn’t get too big and obvious, and it’ll most likely be at your doorstep in two weeks without being caught in customs!

Also, IF any of your orders ever land in customs, yesstyle says they’ll refund you the customs tax excluding the holding fee in store credit."

Im just getting into AB and love to try new stuff... skin type is dry / sensitive, starting to show some fine lines due to dryness but yeah, let’s face it, aging as well."
1593424377.0,1,"Oh I’m in Ireland too and my parcels usually go through Holland. Although I haven’t ordered anything in the last few months. I’ve had to pay customs twice, and they did reimburse me the customs fee but not the €10 handling charge. It says they don’t reimburse handling charges so I guess it depends if you get caught and if your country charges them."
1593426438.0,1,"Thanks for your comment!

No I haven’t ordered from yesstyle yet, but I’ve had to deal with our customs office here before, and seriously this was no fun. It’s not a place I’d like to go again, particularly not with the extra hassle due to the whole COVID situation. 

I’d generally be fine with paying some taxes, if it wasn’t such an annoying process. This is really the only reason that keeps me from ordering directly from yesstyle. The markups in EU based stores can be really huge, that’s true."
1593513255.0,1,"Oh ok that’s interesting... somewhere on their website, yesstyle basically says „please don’t ask us to 
undervalue the package, we won’t do that“ 🤷‍♀️

However, they absolutely must be interested in avoiding taxes for their customers if they offer to refund the fees.

Maybe I’ll just give it a shot..."

1593446348.0,2,I’ve not heard of anyone in Europe getting a customs charge form yesstyle with their normal shipping if that reassures you.
1593513440.0,1,I believe that part is only for legal reasons. All of my packages have been far undervalued so far and I didn’t ask them to do it 😅

Only in the last year has Customs woken up and have I had to pay Customs fees. Yesstyle did reimburse them quickly every time.
I’m in Belgium, by the way."
1593514249.0,1,"Lol ok Good to know 😂

So you never even had to pay turnover tax on imports?

Were the packages of a kind of „believable“ size and weight?

I guess if it gets too big and heavy, that might be a little suspicious..."
1593515139.0,1,"I’ve had my run ins with customs for packages from other shops (BTS merch from Weverse ALWAYS lands in customs 🙄), but the yesstyle stuff always came with NO additional costs, dropped off like a normal package within Germany would.

The packages are typically on the smaller side and with very plain packaging, so it’s believable that it’s actually just a cheap item off amazon or something of the sort.

I wouldn’t do more than 5 bigger/bulkier items (like clothing) per order to be safe with the package size. I’m always worried for nothing tho, all my orders so far were packed tightly that it looked as if it was way less than it actually was."
1593629326.0,1,Quick update from me... I just did it! Placed my order and now I’m really excited 😆
1593637508.0,1,Awesome! I hope you get your stuff soon 👏🏻✨
1593402838.0,3,"The only ones I've tried on your list are Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Mask and CosRx Snail Essence. I've also used the Etude House Soon Jung toner, not Emulsion.

The Purito is nice, but very very lightweight. I don't think it's very occlusive.

I hated the CosRx Snail Essence because it's not hydrating, plus I hate the slimy goopy consistency. If you want a snail product in your routine, I would recommend the CosRx Snail AIO Cream. Ignore the word cream, it's more of a ""whipped essence,"" if you will, mostly a humectant. Snail doesn't do much for me personally so I've stopped using it, but the CosRx Snail AIO is definitely the best snail product I ever tried. It's actually hydrating and absorbent unlike the Essence. And not sticky.

Here are the products I swear by in my Tretinoin routine:

Cleansing Oil: Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil

Cleanser: Heimish All Clean Green Foam

Essence: Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence

Toner: Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, 2sol Cica Youth Toner. I also love Benton Deep Green Tea Toner, but do be aware that it's much less hydrating than 2sol, which is the most hydrating of the 3. It's also less hydrating than Keep Cool.  But I still love it. I'd say it's on ""hydration par"" with Soon Jung toner, but I prefer it to SJ

Serum: Dr. Ceuracle Propolis 33 Ampoule

Moisturizers: 

AM or PM: Curel Intensive Moisture Cream. AMAZING lightweight moisture bomb. So reparative (pseudoceramides)

PM only: Zeroid Intensive Oint Cream, Olivarrier Emollient Extra Comfort Cream (neither is as moisturizing as my HG La Roche Posay Lipikar Balm (non AB) but still good.)

La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume is unbeatable for irritation/inflammation and repair. Unbeatable, I tell you! 😋 I don't know what kind of magic is in it. I think it's a ""more than the sum of its parts"" situation. I tried the Etude House Soon Jung Balm as an alternative because it has similar ingredients but it just wasn't as good.

Every single one of these products is fragrance free. All are focused on soothing, hydrating and moisturizing."
1593404742.0,2,"Purito cleanser is really good and gentle. While I like the Isntree essence, it's just a nice light non sticky gel serum for daytime IMO."
1593405482.0,2,"Consider buffering your tretinoin by mixing it with a basic moisturizer.


Cleanser: Innisfree is quite drying for me, while friends say Purito is a gentler version of Cosrx Low pH.


Serum: Purito Unscented. The Snail Essence is quite light. 


Toner: Soon Jung + Isntree. Never too much hydration 😂


I need to have the La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume and Gel at all times!"

Otherwise, 2sol Cica Youth Toner and Curel Intensive Moisture Cream in addition to LRP."
1593490598.0,1,"It wasn't as occlusive/protective or redness reducing. I think that the Cicaplast is so good because of the mineral components (zinc, copper and manganese.) The Soon Jung doesn't contain those iirc. But the Soon Jung is more lightweight and elegant so there's that."
1593486774.0,1,"I keep things really simple in my Tretinoin routine. The less products the better. I feel like every product dilutes the Tretinoin a bit.

1593490482.0,1,"I don't wait because I've been on Tretinoin for 6 years. But if you're new to Tretinoin you are supposed to wait for the skin to be completely dry before applying because damp skin is more absorbent/permeable, which can cause a lot of irritation."

1593314987.0,8,"Thanks for asking, I'm sorry I didn't clarify this earlier. 
I've tried the Vitamin Tea Tree and Ginseng rinse-off masks. I've also sampled the Rice, Honey, Volcanic Clay and Mugwort masks. 

For reference I used to have dehydrated combination skin and aggressive acne, but after Accutane my skin is now dry and dehydrated. 

IMO: 
Honey mask: best for non-oily skin, since it leaves a layer of film on top the skin after watching which has been described as unpleasant

Volcanic clay: Every skin type could benefit from this. Great at removing sebum and a great gentle exfoliant- skin is very smooth and free of debris after

Mugwort: super calming, this is one of I'm From's most popular rinse-offs. Very calming, and definitely does reduce redness, pigmentation. I'd all skin types would enjoy this. 

Rice: perhaps not oily and combination, since there is something like a waxy residue left behind. 

Vitamin tea tree: All skin types; Gothamista recommends oily skin types keep it on for longer (up to 30 minutes) and as someone who wore it previously with oily skin and now with dry skin I can say this is great for everyone. Skin looks seriously brighter, you can't see my pores anymore. Got to brave yourself the first few minutes of the fermented smell of the mask though- I think it's almost 70% vitamin tea tree leaf, but the results are fabulous!"
1593349724.0,6,They're both really nice! The clay one is quite creamy and has little mugwort leaf pieces in it for kind of a gentle exfoliation (super gentle). The rose one is similar to the Fresh rose mask if you've ever tried that. A cooling jelly/gel texture with rose petals in it.
1593367887.0,1,"Which did you order? I love the clay one for summer since I get super oily and it helps keep my pores clear... but is pretty gentle for a clay mask, doesn't dry too tight. The rose one is great all year round. Just generally calming and cooling."

I find that after every use, my skin glows and looks smoother. You should definitely give this product a try! I am currently on my third bottle of mousse pack now, I seriously swear by this product! I also like how its all foamy when you put on your face, and then the foam will start to fade.. which is like an indication you should wash the mask off (it makes your skincare routine fun too!).

Personally, I have never used their pumpkin mask before, but so far all products I've tried from Too Cool For School have been amazing! They're slightly expensive, but their products are quality! 

If you're interested in trying other products from Too Cool For School, I'd also recommend the egg cream mask (the smell is amazing, plus it really hydrates my skin during cold winter months!), their Artclass by Rodin range (I love the contouring one and the highlighter), their Dinoplatz lip balms (no joke one of the best lip balms/glosses I've ever tried! After trying 1 of their colours, I fell in love and bought 3 more different colours!). I've never tried any from the pumpkin range before, but I've heard many good reviews about them too. So yea you should definitely give this brand a go! You won't regret it! :)"

1593324921.0,3,I also have oily acne prone skin and i would say the honey mask gave me better results and worked more for my skin
1593324915.0,1,oh i can’t decide between vit tea tree and mugwort! both sounds amazing
1593332733.0,1,This is very helpful thank you! I'm quite oily/acne prone so the mugwort one was my first choice. But I've ordered other mugwort products for calming so would like something different to try for a mask and the vitamin tree mask is very tempting
1593655154.0,1,Thanks for your review 😉
1593368272.0,1,The mugwort one! I have a bit of acne and wondering if it’ll help with that
1593374338.0,2,"If it plumps your skin, it can give that effect though! Pores aren't muscles however."
1593295582.0,3,Welcome! Mine lasted me 5 uses so def worth it!
1593402911.0,1,"My main source of info is from past threads on here, the last thing I had heard about Skinfood in general is that the company might shut down. Threads like this sum it up though, at a point no one knew https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/9mo53v/end_of_skinfood_according_to_skinfood_gangnam/

But then I searched it now and saw this- https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/b6e1rr/news_skinfood_is_back/ So it seems like they might be fine. For me the strawberry mask used to be available online on at Ulta and Yesstyle but it’s currently gone from both, so I thought it might be in the process of being discontinued. Based on the thread about them being back though and their official site having it, now I’d say they’re probably doing okay"
1593325527.0,2,"I personally recommend the Vitamin Tea Tree one first. Both are in huge 120g jars, and using it 2-3x a week you can last months on one.

Happy skincare!"
1593336765.0,3,"Not going to lie, it's not the cheapest but a 120g jar is going to last you for at least 3 months; I use it 2-3 times a week (4x/weekly on holiday and I want to max out my skin's nourishment and health without stress) and it really is quite cheap per use compared to sheet masking. 

If your skin is anything like mine, you'll be amazed at how the sebum filaments in pores just disappear, how your skin will have this 'lit within' inner glow and feel so even and texturally smooth. 

Best of luck!"
1593303507.0,4,Seconding the I’m From range. I have the mugwort one and it’s divine.
1593406458.0,1,Oh thank god. I'm glad they're just trying for focus on domestic sales and favorites. Maybe they'll come back to US selling at some point.
1593325756.0,1,may i ask why you would choose that first?
1593317748.0,2,"Hello, this is my first review.

Skin type: oily-combo

So I bought this face mask off Yesstyle after watching one of Hyram’s videos. I have used it a couple of times after I wash my face. Directions say to leave it on for 5-10 mins so I usually leave it for 10 mins. The texture is kind of slimy with real small pieces of mugwort, but I use the white paddle to spread it on my face. This mask does smell kind of bad, probably due to the natural smell of mugworts. When washing the face mask off with warm water, you will definitely feel the slimy texture which sticks to your face so it takes some time to fully wash the whole mask off. After washing it off though, I notice my face looks and feels a lot softer. The mask was also not irritating to my skin."
1593414802.0,1,Hi! Thanks for this. How long did it take for your order to arrive?
1593416268.0,2,"I live in the US and it took the package to arrive in 8 days, but I spent enough on yesstyle to get express shipping which they say takes 5-7 business days and all the items that I bought had a maximum of 3-5 days processing time."
1593416494.0,1,Great! I live in the US too...did you pay any custom duty? I have been wanting to order stuff from YesStyle but always back out due to customs and their shipping times.
1593417050.0,2,"I did not have to pay any custom duty and I have ordered numerous times from them before and I never had to pay customs fees. And if you plan to order from Yesstyle soon, they have an extra 12% off code on their website (SUMMER2020) which you can use but I don’t know when the code expires. I also recommend making sure all the items in your cart have short processing times or else your order can take longer to arrive."
