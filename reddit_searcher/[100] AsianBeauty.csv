1593926609.0,3,"What‚Äôs the best product to prevent oncoming pimples? 

I‚Äôve had oily, acne-prone skin for ages now and it‚Äôs gotten much better. Recently I‚Äôve been getting a couple large, painful cystic acne every once in awhile. [This](https://imgur.com/a/bXD51Un) is one gigantic and painful pimple. There‚Äôs also a few more rising in the cheek area. So asking r/AsianBeauty for some help here. Which product do you use to prevent these?"
1593937743.0,2,"Skin type:combo (oily t zone and dry cheeks and chin)
Country: Canada
Skin concern: deep physical scarring on cheeks, fungal acne on forehead

Routine
AM
-wash my face with water
-alpha abrutin +HA (from ordinary)
-vitamin C suspension 23% (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 

PM
-cerave foaming cleanser
-glycolic acid toner (from ordinary)
-alpha abrutin +HA
-niacinamide (from ordinary)
-hemi Squalane oil (from ordinary)
-clinique moisturizer 


I recently bought these ordinary products so this routine is new. I am looking add few more products containing BHA or benzyl peroxide but am not sure which ones. While browsing I came across coarx snail mucin which is suppose to help with scaring, but I am not sure if I should purchase it. I am also interested in stridex bha 2% acne pads, de la ruz sulfur ointment treatment and paul‚Äôs choice bha 2% exolinat. Again I am not sure which one to incorporate. Please give me suggestions about these products or any other that you have in mind that could help with acne scars or fu gal acne."
1593939243.0,2,"Recently I‚Äôve pared down my routine to just a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, with vit c at night and spf in the morning, but I find my skin feeling tight and dry later on in the day. I would say I have combo/dehydrated skin, and I live on the east coast of the US so right now the climate can be either humid or dry, but pretty hot either way.

AM:

Krave matcha cleanser

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

Purito unscented spf 

PM: 

Krave matcha cleanser

Timeless vit c

Purito green centella toner

iunik centella gel cream

I‚Äôve been thinking about adding in the hada labo lotion after toner or finding a heavier moisturizer, but I‚Äôm scared an actual cream will be too heavy for the summer... any suggestions?"
1593949999.0,1,"I have oily skin/combination.
FA
Hyperpigmentation/scars

I wanted to get the purito defense cleanser and the iunik calming gel. But neither are currently available for me... so any suggestions?"
1593933749.0,1,"Question about lightening acne marks! I tried Shark Sauce and wasn't impressed, should I give it more time (used it twice a day for a little over two weeks)? Or should I switch to something stronger, like Double Shark (does that even make a difference?) I'm not tied to niacinamide either, I've been eyeing vitamin C products too, specifically Melano CC. I just worry about how strong everyone says that is and the possibility of breaking out. Have you used these products? How do you think they compare in their ability to lighten acne marks?"
1593946035.0,1,do you know of any fungal acne safe cleansing oils? I want to use my sunscreen but I don‚Äôt have anything to remove it with. Thanks so much !
1593949579.0,1,"Any advice for dark under-eye circles? It seems like no matter how much I sleep, they won‚Äôt go away. The best thing I‚Äôve tried so far is a caffeine serum from The Ordinary, but it‚Äôs so temporary. I‚Äôm hoping for something that has more long-lasting effects. Thanks in advance!"
1593952121.0,1,Hey AB! How often do people extract blackheads? I'm interest to get start into my new products!
1593952242.0,1,"How do you apply mascara properly?  

I bought the heroine make long and curl super waterproof mascara, but honestly no clue if I‚Äôm applying it currently. 

Do I curl before or after? Both? I have very straight lashes and they usually seem less curled after I apply the mascara to my curled lashes. 

Any tips?"
1593941946.0,3,"Hi, I'm also in Canada and first of all why are you awake lol its so late!

Anyways, a big tip for your TO products is to switch the application time of your Niacinamide and your Vit C. Idk about you, but the gritty texture of the vitamin c is pretty uncomfortable for the daytime and can affect makeup application, plus the high concentration can cause sensitivity, so it's best used at night. 

If you're looking for benzyl peroxide there's a Canadian-made product called Benzagel which is sold in drugstores/online! Its not AB, but it's cheap and good quality so whatever. 

As for the BHA products, Stridex Pads work pretty well, but you might get irritated at first. However, I'd go for either the Paula's choice or Cosrx bha power liquid or Cosrx bha/aha toner, because I think that the pads in the stridex are such a waste. I see that most of the products in your routine are western skin care brands, and since you are posting in r/AsianBeauty, why not look for some AB products? I know Klairs has a really good Vit C serum, and Cosrx is the best brand to start with, almost all their products are good quality and effective. For treating fungal acne, you should actually use an antifungal shampoo, but you really have to be sure its fungal acne, so I'd say ask a dermatologist."
1593947256.0,1,\^\^It might be good to exchange your toner for an essence! (or simply add an essence to your routine)
1593952094.0,1,2 weeks isn‚Äôt enough time. Give it around 3 months. Melano CC isn‚Äôt particularly strong compared to 15% L-AA.
1593951928.0,1,"Curel Makeup Cleansing Gel. Or you can DIY with squalane or MCT, Cromollient SCE and a preservative."
1593951115.0,1,"Most probably it's genetic then, or your facial bone structure that is causing the shadow. Unfortunately I doubt any topical can help with that. Make sure you aren't deficient in nutrients too, usually iron deficiency also can cause dark circle - check with your GP for this"
1593952456.0,1,I usually curl it first then use the mascara. I try my best to coat it from the root but make sure to not touch the skin haha. Hope that helps xoxo ‚ô•Ô∏è
1593942939.0,1,"My sleeping schedule is so messed up I be sleeping in the morning and staying awake at nightüòÇ
I am super confused about the order of the products tbh. On the deciem website I was recommended to follow this routine because  apparently you shouldn‚Äôt be using glycolic acid and Vitamin C in the same routine. 

I am really interested in purchasing some Cosrx products. Where should I buy them? Is iHerb a good place? 

Thank you so much for the help!"
1593952331.0,1,thanks so much !!
1593943717.0,1,"lmaoo same im basically nocturnal at this point. Anyways I totally overlooked the fact that you have glycolic acid in ur routine, in that case the order you have it rn works too! I actually think you might have too many actives tho, you could maybe do the vitamin c every other day, so that ur able to layer other products without worry about any potential problems. Also, do you use a sunscreen? I dont think i saw it in ur description. 

As for where to buy stuff, iHerb is a pretty good place to get them, if yesstyle shipping prices ever go down then that is a good place too, also sukoshi mart has an online shop now with a pretty good AB selection! Sometimes Amazon and eBay might work too lol.

np and good luck on ur skincare journey :)"
1593945416.0,1,"Yeah I do but I forgot to mention it since i barely go out anymore. 

I heard it is a shady website n imma hella scared to make any purchases from there. People say they had to pay extra taxes or duties after the payment, but many things are on sale right now on there."
1593852537.0,11,"I finally gave in and ordered from yesstyle even though the klairs toner was way overpriced (but cheaper than in my own country) and i was dumb enough to add 1 thing that ships in 21 days. Im already out of the klairs and running out of more stuff so i really don't want to wait. 
Lesson here: always double check the shipping time on yesstyle"

1593898896.0,2,I feel you. 2 weeks ago I placed an order (first time with yesstyle) and didnt realize one product had to wait 7-14 days to ship. Now 15 days later still hasnt shipped and in the product description still says 7-14 days to ship. Im mad at my own stupidity :(

1593894399.0,23,"A'pieu madecassoside cica gel. It has no added fragrance or essential oils. I buy it by the 100ml tube! Also, the A'pieu madecassoside Sleeping Mask. Just ordered 2 more of those to make sure I don't run out."
1593893405.0,8,Does anyone know a good toner/essence/serum with centella that‚Äôs not skin1004?
1593893914.0,9,"I like the cica creams bc they're super soothing, iope has one, but it's super hard to get now, so I just stick to the klairs midnight blue in the fridge. 

Also the cosrx centella ampoule which is super soothing. Also both the benton deep green tea and isntree green tea toners have cica in them as well and are pretty soothing. 

Side note: Is it me, or is the skin1004 ampoule greasy, I feel like it does nothing?"
1593910615.0,9,I love the Etude House Soonjung Cica Balm. It soothes my acne bumps and heals them really fast after I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pops them.
1593896199.0,5,i know cica cream isn't \*exactly\* the same thing but has anyone here tried the dr. jart cicapair? i've seen so many people raving about it and i think my next purchase is going to be either purito or this one
1593902261.0,7,"Has anyone tried Sioris' A Calming Day Ampoule? Looking to try it once I've gone through my last bottle of A'Pieu madecassoside ampoule, but the only drawback is it's almost double the price and haven't heard many reviews on it."

1593923642.0,3,Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner... it also has licorice root and aloe in it as well. Dries down without being sticky.
1593929078.0,3,"Dr. Belmeur Advanced Cica Recovery Cream is great! It's pretty lightweight but does good things for my dry skin especially using it on top of a facial oil (I use squalane)

Sidenote... I just have to say it. Purito sucks as a sunblock. Absolutely sucks! I don't know why everyone here loves it. I feel like people just love the texture (it is very moisturizing) and formula but don't realize it's not very effective. It doesn't last at all. I bought some to give it a shot and wore it out today, reapplying the correct amount (two finger-length lines) and patting it in at appropriate intervals. I got sunburned on my face for the first time in *years*! It's not a bad burn, thankfully, but I was stunned at first. I guess I'm not surprised after seeing that UV camera post that showed how poorly it lasts."

1593897503.0,3,"The Skin 1004 Ampoule did nothing for me, also at one point the company broke down the Centella terpinoids and it did not contain Madecassoside (the most important terpinoid imo.) I think that's why it didn't do anything."

1593911534.0,3,Pretty sure that‚Äôs the same thing. I have gone through a full tube of it and bought another 2 at about $20 each at TJ Maxx. Does wonders for my tret-irritated skin and random red pimples on my back and chest.

1593949357.0,1,"Its so difficult having sensitive skin. You see all these skincare products being adored by many youtubers and then you find an ingredient which doesn't suit you. Its so irritating! 

Since we have the same skin type and similar preferences, please tell me which sunscreens are your HG??"
1593950838.0,1,"I knoow right ! But after searching more and since I follow some youtubers who avoid fragrance I found many products without it. If you're looking for a type of product don't hesitate to ask.


For sunscreen I still haven't found my HG but I'm planning to try bioderma ar tinted spf 50. Bioderma is an amazing brand for sensitive skin I aleeady use two of their products. The purito centella unscented spf 50 also has a lot of great reviews."
1593951056.0,1,"Purito UV scented is chemical sunscreen which is why I am still hesitating to get that. I am considering purito comfy block. Ah yes, bioderma is what I am looking at too.

Out of curiosity, do you follow Kelly Driscoll and Dr Dray? I follow them and they have helped a lot!"
1593951601.0,1,"Yes that's why I'm still hesitating too, bioderma is also a chemical sunscreen but the UVA protection is better than purito sunscreens that's why I wanted to try it this summer.

Yees hahah that's the youtubers I was talking about üòÑ It's dr dray who recommended  bioderma photoderm ar spf in one of her videos."

1593858446.0,97,"Recently I decided to incorporate Aquaphor into my routine to help with Tretinoin dryness, because everyone seems to like it (lol). Itching like I have never had before. I thought it was just the usual tret irritation, so kept it up a few more nights until it got to the point I wanted to claw my face off. I thought maybe it was the Lanolin in it, so switched to Vaseline and cut out the tret, thinking the tret was sensitizing my face to the Lanolin. I immediately had the same reaction, except five times worse. I had to wash it all off multiple times within a few hours, it was that unbearable. I cut out all skincare for a few days and am just getting back to applying a bare minimum routine of moisturizer + SPF / tret. I have such sensitive skin, I wish I could be more surprised that I apparently react to petroleum jelly of all things."
1593862232.0,88,"After trying out several AB samples I'd received following some time in the exchange sub, I finally placed one large order for all of the products that were successful samples for me. Then when they all arrived, I started using them all at once. And my skin freaked out. Even though I knew all the products worked for me, starting them all at once was a huge mistake. I stopped using all of them and went back to my original routine then started adding in one new product at a time for at least a week or two before adding the next product into the routine. Please don't be like me. Remember to only add one new product at a time until you know it's ok."
1593855033.0,45,"Cleansing oils (I tried Shu Uemura & Hada Labo) unfortunately broke me out and I continued using for half a year without realizing, switched to Hada Labo to try again but still the same results.

Also accidentally irritated my skin when I had a pimple and applied multiple products (including The Body Shop tea tree oil & 10% benzoyl peroxide) to try to curb it. It still hasn‚Äôt fully recovered and I can‚Äôt apply even just tea tree oil without irritating it."
1593857039.0,34,"The first time I got into AB I went to some well-reviewed AB-oriented shop and somehow got convinced to spend $200ish on an alcohol-based toner, a meh cleanser, and a moisturizer that all lasted me a month or so.

Nowadays my routine is like 40-50 bucks for 6 months lol."
1593875466.0,17,"I went on a shopping spree and bought a bunch of Paula's Choice serums, and a new hair conditioner (can you guess where this is going?). A few days later I had a full body rash and I started panic removing products from my routine. I was so upset that all these lovely serums would go to waste and I was back to square one... cut to now, a few weeks later, I've tested each serum and found out it was actually the damn hair product. Lesson learned, test all your products!!"
1593849816.0,31,"I‚Äôm the type to never really get irritated by any skincare even with fragrance, EOs, etc. and I **used** to just buy anything and everything. Basically my skin isn‚Äôt very sensitive. 

Which makes my skincare fails even more INTENSE (for me) because I was so shocked that my skin actually got irritated lol. The first was the SNP animal panda whitening mask. It felt like it was burning but I thought it was part of the ~process~ (yes, my mistake) and after taking it off my face was so red and stingy. I looked tan for like 3 weeks after! 

The Cosrx hydrogel very simple packs irritated my cheeks too but not my forehead for some reason >.<"
1593870226.0,9,"I've gotten used to exfoliating twice a week. I didn't take into consideration that now that I have to wear a mask everyday at work for 8 hours, my face is much more sensitive and irritated (even though it is a soft cotton mask). On top of that, since it is summer my skin is even more sensitive from going to 3 months quarantine with barely any sun exposure to seeing lots of sun everyday. 

But I kept up exfoliating twice a week a long with a million step routine and it made my skin so red, angry and painful. I've finally wisened up and only exfoliate once during the weekend and shorten my routine steps during the week. My face has healed up nicely, although it is still a feat to get through the mask wearing week without pissing my skin off too much."

1593851091.0,16,"Cosrx rice overnight spa mask caused weird bumps between my eyebrows and red spots on my cheeks.

Cosrx holy moly snail mask made my skin dull.

(I still love cosrx as a brand tho)

Round Lab Dokdo cream broke me out horribly.

Missha total ceramide cream gave me closed comedones.

Skin and Lab barrierderm relief balm also caused breakouts ony dry skin.

( I think shea butter and silicone combined don't agree with my skin)

Isntree green tea lotion was too too drying for my dry dehydrated skin.

Purito centella buffet serum and centella suncreen made me realize that bergamot oil irritates my skin and lavender oil irritates my eyes. Good thing they came out with Unscented versions without those essential oils which are now my HG!"
1593861834.0,5,"The Innisfree green tea seed serum was the worst one for me. Horrible rash and swelling that only subsided with hydrocortisone. Still don't know what caused that reaction.

Ithough maybe it was something else so i tried the apieu one too and the same thing happened. Guess my skin doesnt like centella. big sad."
1593859056.0,4,I tried sidmool's niacinamide serum and the ordinary's 10% niacinamide and i find both did.. nothing? I see lots of people with good results from incorporating a good dose of niacinamide in their routine but i didn't see much difference. I also felt like some water-like toners (like roundlab dokdo toner) does absolutely nothing. Cosrx AHA burns my skin barrier away when i'm only using it once a week. Also not exactly a skincare fail but i find makeup goes on blotchy on top of matte sunscreens.
1593861864.0,3,I used benzoyl peroxide 5% I think on my face as a 20yo and then woke up in the morning and lightly wet my face with water the next day. Within 18 hours my skin was full blown chemically burnt and was for over a week.

As soon as I stop using the product, everything goes back to normal.It's really a shame because I love the ethics of this brand, but apparently their products are not for me !

And Granactive retinoids from TO : it immediately lits my face on fire."
1593882161.0,4,"Thinking differin and benzoyl peroxide was the miracle cure for moderate to severe acne, I started caking on benzoyl and differin every day and probably gave myself way worse cystic acne and scars on my left side that was usually pretty clear."
1593884427.0,4,"My skin has been absolutely *terrible* the past few months. I'm not sure what caused everything, but knowing that my skin is already dry, sensitive, and acne-prone while having problems with eczema since I was like 10 or 11 (am 23 now) made me realize that some of the new things I recently tried were pretty dumbass things to do lol.

When quarantine started, I decided it would be a good time to try to use up all of the skincare I had bought and either didn't really like that much or couldn't find a place in my routine to use them due to finding other products that I loved and shared the same purpose. Of course, a lot of those products had fragrance in them, and there were a ton of sheet masks I wanted to use up as fast as possible. *Well, imagine my shock* when my face started getting drier with more acne. Shortly after, I also started getting tiny bumps all over my skin (I still don't know if that's fungal acne or a ton of CCs since it kind of looks like FA but doesn't itch at all, which is why I have a derm appointment at the end of this month). 

I stopped that plan and decided to just use what worked for me while adding in some exfoliating products. I only exfoliated once or twice a week, so I thought maybe I should do more? I only had the Krave Kale-la-lu-yaha glycolic acid and didn't want to use too much of that, so I got the CeraVe SA Renewing cleanser to use every other day. I figured it would be a gentler but more consistent way of exfoliating since I would be washing it off after a shorter time of contact with my skin. I also used the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating cleanser any time I didn't use the SA cleanser (FYI, I only cleanse at night and use a rosewater toner to wipe off any residue in the morning). 

Of course, I then came across the 60-second cleansing method that's supposedly good for any skin type and supposedly saved tons of people's skin. I started using that method when I regularly cleansed at night, but then I saw some people saying you need to do it with all of your cleansing products every morning and night and oil cleanser should be used even if you just wear sunscreen instead of makeup during the day. Three days after double-cleansing at night and cleansing in the morning one time (still switching between the Krave and CeraVe cleansers every other day and using the iUNIK Calendula Complete cleansing oil as my first cleanse at night), I had bumps, dryness, and inflammation all over my face. I had completely destroyed my skin barrier.

I immediately stopped everything I was doing and just used one moisturizer (Benton Deep Green Tea lotion), one sunscreen, (Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun SPF45 PA+++), and one cleanser (Krave). My skin was a lot better after the first week or so, but it was still dry, so I started using the Benton Cacao Moist and Mild cream at night. 

Now that it's been a little over a month, my skin has mostly gone back to normal. I still have some pustules, the maybe/maybe not FA, and some dryness (which is mostly because I've been crying for like a week since we found out one of our cats is in liver failure and we have to put her down in two days üôÉ 2020 is the worst year), but my skin overall seems to be in better condition. Last week, I started using TO Niacinamide again to see if it would help the maybe/maybe not FA and to just finish it off because I actually hate the texture of it and feel like it makes my face 10x drier. The bumps on my forehead have reduced a little, so I'm going to finish off products I'm using right now and use the two products I have that are FA safe: Hada Labo Gokujyun Moist lotion and Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing gel (still gonna use the Krave cleanser, and I just bought like three bottles of the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented sunscreen before finding out it wasn't FA safe, so I'm still gonna use those). I'd buy more FA safe products and treatments now, but I'm still not sure that I actually have FA and am kinda afraid to try anything too intense because of my chronic eczema.

On the bright side, I've almost completely eliminated fragrance from my routine."

It was crazy and I was completely disappointed. Now I stick to aloe vera :/
1593879785.0,3,"Niacinamide sensitivity? - read so much positive feedback about this ingredient, had really high expectation. 

Tried a couple of times to incorporate it into my routine. First with TO 10% + zinc, then again with a K-beauty toner Rovectin and Olay regenerist which both has niacinamide listed pretty high on the ingredient list. I didn‚Äôt use them all at once, only a couple of drops and tried them all separately with no layering involved so basically my routine was just salicylic acid wash, any of the above followed by a light moisturiser. 

Every single time I get tiny white bumps all over my forehead, cheeks, everywhere the day after."

1593899627.0,3,"My most glorious fail was using the Cosrx Snail Essence and Mizon snail BB cream. 

I bought them because I heard sooo many rave reviews online, I have always had issues with dry skin so thought they'd work well. Initially bought the BB cream and loved it, however after a while I started experiencing breakouts. Didn't really think much of it. Some time later I bought the Cosrx essence, and that is when (for a lack of a better term) sh*t hit the fan. The essence worsened my breakouts to the point where I was experiencing borderline cystic acne and I stupidly used the products in conjunction for a long time. At some point I must have put two and two together and stopped using them and lo and behold, my skin cleared up. At some point I tried to use the essence again and immediately after first use I broke out so needless to say I yeeted that thing straight in the bin. Haven't used snail products since (about two years now) and I have never had anything like this happen again.

One thing I since realised in hindsight- when I first bought the Mizon BB cream, my mum told me she tried using a snail cream in the past but she was allergic and had to stop using it. I stupidly thought it wouldn't apply to me so went ahead with using the products mentioned. What a mistake!!

Sorry for the long comment but yeah ... Just because a product is popular and works wonders for a majority of the people, doesn't mean it will work for you..! I leaned that the hard way lol"
1593905366.0,3,I tried going to a facialist for peels for an entire year only to discover that what my skin likes best is being entirely left alone except for a $4 Korean madecassoside cream and a retinol.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was because of the serum or my terrible sleep schedule at the time, so I tried using it again and the same thing happened. Quite disappointed. Never again."
1593868749.0,2,"never ever try Madeca Derma Cream, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you're a beginner in skincare. I saw it from a Filipina vlogger she was so confident that the product is like a magical cream, she even invited people to testify the product's effectivity in her channel to prove that it really worksüôÑ, she also recommended to just keep using it even if you're breaking out from it saying that its normal because you'll experience purging. I paired madeca with cetaphil cleanser, garnier micellar water(pink) and belo whitening sunscreen, it's impossible that the breakout was from these products because i was using it way before i tried madeca. Overall madeca only worsened my skin condition, i thought the micro-peeling effect was a good sign, i didnt know that its already damaging my skin barrier,  i was a beginner in skincare so i was so naive and got swayed easily lol, i didnt even read the ingredients list because i trusted it so much, denatured alcohol was the top ingredient of madeca and it also consist of shea butter, and a bunch of different essential oils, basically it has all the worst ingredients that you can think of lol. I used to idolize that filipina vlogger bc her skincare reviews and makeup tutorials are always on point and she seems very credible lol, but lesson learned never trust anyone but experts(Hyram is counted lol)."
1593873256.0,2,Using cyspera in the morning then washing it off and adding acids after that. I got a headache and puked tons after that. Now the stench from cyspera reminds me of puke. It really stinks. I really discourage anyone from using it on your face. The smell is soooo hard to wash off. Probably better for pigmentation on other areas of your body.
1593875315.0,2,"Months ago i tried the Purito centella buffet serum. I had high hopes and my skin looked fantastic for a couple of days, then i started breaking out in tiny blisters that turned into pimples that wouldn't heal. Apparently that high a concentration of centella asiatica sensitized me to that ingredient and now i can't use anything with centella without breaking out in little allergic blister pimples. Had to stop using several products i really liked because my skin suddenly won't tolerate them."

1593880714.0,2,"The Cosrx snail mucin was my first AB product ever. I was so excited to try it because it had such amazing reviews. One week later I had broken out with the WORST cystic acne since I was a teenager. Then I went down the rabbit hole of using harsh products like the Dr. Dennis Gross peeling pads and clay masks. I ended up going on meds. It‚Äôs been a couple of years but I still flinch when I see people talk about snail products. The Cosrx sent me down a very misguided path and I learned about skincare the hard way. I wish I had known that YMMV and to start slow!

1593884056.0,2,"It was around five years ago during my first year of living the AB lifestyle. I had heard so many good things about vitamin C so I decided to incorporate it into my routine, which was still mostly in trial mode as I was working on finding the most efficient products for my skin. So I ordered the C20 vitamin C serum and started using it, if I remember correctly I didn't rush it, took it slow. 

My skin seemed to be okay with it at first, but not long after I started to get huge angry pimples on my cheeks and chin. No idea why I didn't immediately suspect the latest new product, I guess I really wanted to believe in it. At some point I had a disgusting trio of the ugliest biggest pimples on my right cheek a centimeter from my nose. You can imagine how horrified I was, but no matter what I did, they wouldn't go away. I had never before had any sort of breakout on my cheeks before that, even during my teens only my T-zone was ever affected. 

I fought hard, even got several very specific products to fight them, such as Cosrx Asol, lots of blemish patches and ointments, but they kept on coming and always appeared in the same area. At some point I gave up and accepted my fate, but then I suddenly ran out of my vit C serum and luckily hadn't ordered a new one yet. Lo and behold, after going without for an amount of time my skin cleared up and ever since that time I haven't had any breakouts on my cheeks. At that point I finally made the connection between vitamin C serum and the breakouts so I have steered clear of vitamin C since then."
1593895331.0,2,"Last night I applied a pea sized blob of the Uruoi Deep Moisture Gel that I just purchased and it felt great. Until I went to bed that is, it stayed fairly tacky/sticky and I had applied it down my neck too, so I kept sticking to my pillow. Perhaps it is a daytime only moisturizer for me now.

My long-term, never again, not in a million years fail is the CosRX Galactomyces Essence. Triggered a seborrheic dermatitis flare with rashes on my face that would migrate in patches (left cheek to right cheek, forehead, down the sides of my face, etc) and I didn't know what was going on for several months, and it was hot, red, and scaly. It's caused by the same yeast as fungal acne, so I had to adopt an FA-safe routine and it finally cleared up. Took about a year to resolve actually and I was very afraid of oils in any skincare item for a long time. It's been about 4 years now and I'm only now cautiously trying a few oils in my routine again. The Uruoi product mentioned above is one of them. No fermented ingredients (namely galactomyces) for me!"

1593919833.0,2,"Definitely over-exfoliating my face and not even knowing it was a thing! 

Started off (3 years ago!) with bumps on my forehead before I went on holiday to Jordan which is extremely hot. While I was there, I wanted to try and get an acne cream so I bought the first thing I saw which was tret as I didn't have much knowledge into how strong these acne treatments were and it was easily bought otc. I cringe everytime I think of this but I would use this EVERYDAY without spf and go into the hot sun to tan. This started making things noticeably worse. In hindsight, I think it was fungal acne fed by the heat and products I was using however I didn't even know that was a thing at the time.

I didn't even realise the damage I'd done and the over-exfoliation led to a constant cycle of more spots on my forehead which I tried to tackle with even more harsh products. My routine  then consisted of a salicylic acid cleanser with one of those even harsher spin brushes, glycolic acid pads straight after, and then benzoyl peroxide! I want to cry everytime I remember this routine. Sometimes I'd even add in a cheeky st ives or overnight glycolic acid mask. My face kept deteriorating, it was always red and it actually looked like leather at one point. It was shiny, but so dry to the touch I felt like I could see my reflection in it and at the time there wasn't much on over-exfoliation so I didn't even realise what the problem was. 

Needless to say I was fighting a losing battle with my skin for the last 3 years because even after I found out my moisture barrier was absolutely destroyed, it was impossible to find products that would heal it without clogging pores and feeding fungal acne. It was a nightmare. But yeah, think it's finally on the mend lol"

More recently, my Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel waterproof sunscreen seems to have caused some huge, irritated red bumps on my temple, along with other scattered pimples. I really like this stuff, so I'm going to give it another go and hope it's just a matter of cleansing more thoroughly since it's waterproof.

A couple summers ago I finally started using the Hada Labo Premium Gokujyun lotion and while I can‚Äôt 100% scientifically prove it was that, ha, my lips got SO dry and dehydrated, to the point where it hurt to smile.

The brand does have some fragrance-free options though, so you just have to search."
1593930354.0,1,"I didn't attribute it to the fragrance at the time since (A) I use other products (like Innisfree green tea seed serum) which have way more fragrance and don't break me out. I haven't had an issue with fragrance in general and while I know all chemicals are supposed to smell, I genuinely don't like it. I do, however, switch to fragrance-free in case the fragranced version doesn't work for me. Also (B) I've broken out with hyaluronic acid sheet masks earlier when I used to use sheet masks (now I don't) so I think it's just the wrong product for me.

Edit: that sunblock works fine for me but I don't like the pasty feeling so I've switched to Loreal Aqua Essence which seems to be a more elegant formulation. Wish we had more AB products to choose from where I live, it's such a pain :/"
1593881147.0,2,"This was the time when I was starting to explore skincare. I used to lurk in Girl Talk forum, and there was one thread about mineral makeup. One of the tips there was to remove mineral makeup using extra virgin olive oil. I thought that was a hard rule when it comes to mineral makeup usage. :P"
1593918260.0,1,Oh yes I‚Äôve used elta MD and using purito mineral sunscreens and they haven‚Äôt broken me out!! But they both have some level of pilling. Do any of those not pill?
1593898162.0,2,"There‚Äôs a lot of overlap in many of the items! But I do notice some differences in some of the hype products. 

In Korea the Round Lab Dokdo line has been pretty raved about, especially the toner. But I think people here enjoy this as well. Round Lab‚Äôs Birch Juice line is also gaining some traction, especially their moisturizing cream and UV sun cream. Something I don‚Äôt see often here from Round Lab is their 365 Derma Relief Sun Cream. It‚Äôs a highly rated sunscreen in Korea but rarely do I see it talked about here. 

Also, Be Plain Chamomile Toner and their Cicaful Ampoule is raved about. I see these a bit on here though. One thing I noticed is a lot of calming and soothing ingredients are focused on in Korea. Repairing the skin barrier was huge for a while.

Something I don‚Äôt see here as often is The Lab by Blanc Doux. Their Hyaluronic Toner was quite a craze a while ago after Director Pi on Youtube suggested it. It apparently has different molecular weights of hyaluronic acid so it‚Äôs more effective at locking in moisture. 

Another big brand in Korea that I rarely see here is Sidmool. A lot of their products are highly rated, especially their moisturizers and hydrating products. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt seem to find them anywhere online for international shipping :( 

FYI - I probably missed a lot and this list might be a little outdated! Director Pi on Youtube has had a huge impact on Korean skincare and how people purchase products. She puts english subs on most of her videos too so, maybe try checking her out for more product info!"
1593896136.0,1,I‚Äôm worried that my skin has developed a sensitivity to chemical sunscreens because I tried a couple other ones without fragrance and they burned too :(
1593882708.0,2,It is OK to use them together. I mix Niacinamide and vitamin C all the time. In fact Paula's Choice call it a 'winning combination'. With exception of TO because of their own formulation
1593883060.0,3,Do you put on anything under cicaplast ?
1593866689.0,11,I'm the same! I can't use oil cleansers as they irritate my skin like no other. I can only use micellar water and gel or foam cleansers to double cleanse.
1593868834.0,6,Ok thanks. I wear mineral sunscreen and my micellar water just doesn't quite seem to remove it thoroughly. I'm still looking for that magic non clogging cleanser but maybe it's just my skin haha
1593891614.0,1,I'm also the same! Been using micellar water and still on the hunt for that good cleansing oil but haven't had any luck yet. Damn sensitive skin
1593880404.0,1,"I probably read it from articles for rosewater, about how it has almost no side effects compared to other essential oils like teatree oil etc, and when I checked TBS's tea tree oil review for my country, many report breakouts. I am thinking of getting Mario Badescu drying lotion for spot treatment; have you tried it?"
1593861126.0,14,"Let me guess... you also have perfect skin and never break out? There really is something to having a pared down, simple routine. Starting to realise less is probably more when it comes to skincare.

My bf also uses Hada Labo (he took it from me) over a water facial mist along with a Biore sunblock I bought him for daytime. At night he just washes his face with water and he uses my Cosrx gel face wash whenever he feels ""a little oily,"" which is every two weeks or so -_- That's it, and he practically has no visible pores or skin problems to speak of."
1593937039.0,1,please add SPF to your skincare routine....
1593896203.0,2,Is it normal to purge every time with aha/bha? I always get little bumps after aha that go away after a day. I‚Äôm not sure what to think of them as they aren‚Äôt true pimples.
1593866029.0,4,"it might be 1,3-propanediol. if your skin1004 ""100% centella"" ampoule is 90% 1,3-propanediol, 10% centella extract powder, that would certainly explain why you have issues with it.  a lot of these diols and glycols are well tolerated at low concentrations but not high.

i have it, too, and i would choose a different carrier."
1593937729.0,1,"Hi! Currently I only use TO products for PM routine; so I start immediately with the Niacinamide, and then AA, and then Innisfree's cream spread thinly. :D"
1593922212.0,2,"I didn't buy it to use as a hydrating layer, I'm just using it as a hydrating layer, given that it can't serve any other purpose in my routine (I have other products that I prefer for the other stuff it's supposed to do)"
1593887629.0,1,I see! I‚Äôve also been thinking about trying it (with oil during the night and on its own in daytime cuz I also use sunscreen). My face is oily naturally and it doesn‚Äôt get dehydrated easily so I have some hope. Thanks for the reply!
1593932445.0,1,"Interesting. Yeah hyaluronic acid generally works with most skin types altho some particular products can cause reactions. For example, I love the Habo Lado Gokujyun Moisturizing Lotion, but I have read from some people on here that it made them break out. So not sure if it‚Äôs the formulation or other ingredients, or ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And where do you live? Generally Amazon is an all-around solid choice that can sometimes net you much lower prices than from Asian boutiques or even a product‚Äôs actual brand website. But it‚Äôs also frustrating because not all AB products are on Amazon."
1593918352.0,2,I haven‚Äôt experienced pilling. Could vary by skin type though. I am oily.
1593900112.0,1,"Hmm, that may be the case. When we slather chemical sunscreen on our faces daily, I feel like eventually we'll develop sensitivities. It's a fine line :/ Also, the burning may be happening if your moisture barrier is compromised. Just a thought!"
1593887003.0,1,"Some nights I cleanse, then Clindamycin (topical liquid form), then Cicaplast, then tretinoin. Some nights I flip the order of the tret and Cicaplast.

I haven‚Äôt tried Cicaplast in the morning yet, as I‚Äôm not sure how it will interact with my Vitamin C serum, sunscreen, and makeup. It might make my face too dewy for daytime? Not sure!"
1593872804.0,11,"Feels rare to find more people with cleansing oil intolerance! Cleansing oils are always touted as THE ultimate double cleansing product, sucks that I can‚Äôt reap all the benefits."
1593902325.0,3,"I get irritated from oil and balm cleansers that emulsify and rinse off with water. My skin would always feel tight and dry, but I realised it was happening only after rinsing off. I‚Äôve started just wiping it off with a tissue before going in with a gentle second cleanse to get the remainder off and that seems to solve the issue. It seems a little counterintuitive since the main appeal of these new generation oil cleansers is that they do rinse clean, but boy something in that mechanism dried my skin out so much. In future I might just switch to oil cleansing with a traditional oil and since I‚Äôm using my second cleanser to do the emulsify and rinse part anyway."
1593872696.0,1,Perhaps adding a toner step with cotton pad to hydrate + wipe off any residue could help? It‚Äôs what I do too but I never find any residue. I use hada labo deep clean & blemish face wash if that helps. Good luck finding the perfect products for you!
1593866644.0,4,I wonder if girls can do less routine too ><
1593872515.0,1,Wow I wasn't aware of both of these things. Thankyou so much!
1593906186.0,1,"i see, then i might consider trying out those powdered centella and just mixing a bit with my toner to check.ty"
1593873794.0,7,"I'm actually surprised too, I've never expected other people to have the same experience as I do with oil cleansers. It's so universally liked and talked about. Yes, I totally get what you mean, I'm always super jealous of people for being able to use oil cleansers, especially when they talk about how easy it is to use, the pore cleaning action (grits), etc."
1593872897.0,8,"Tbh I scaled my routine back a ton after a few years of going berserk with skincare and my skin has been happier for it.

I am lucky that i overall have decent skin. It‚Äôs very tolerant of new items and i don‚Äôt get significant acne unless there‚Äôs a real trigger.

My only real issues are old acne scars from the dark ages, largeish pores, and minor fine lines (I‚Äôm in my 30s). So I have maybe 2-3 actives that I use. Vitamin c a few times a week, retinol nightly, and SA when my skin gets rough (maybe a few times a month if that).

I cut out all the rest of the experiments and haven‚Äôt had any negative affects by doing so"
1593894055.0,3,You need to do what works for your skin. I spent a decade on variations of very minimal routines. My 8 step routine has been transformative for my skin. If I try to scale back on anything my skin back slides in some way.
1593872656.0,1,"Yes, they definitely can. I'm trying to simplify my current skincare routine because I see people getting great results with far less than I'm using. I think simpler products with less ingredients are key. All the potential chemicals and stuff I'm layering on is starting to concern me as I've had contact and seborrheic dermatitis in the past, likely from compromising my skin's natural barrier."

1593891178.0,2,Wym by ‚Äúpotential chemicals‚Äù? Everything is a chemical
1593911121.0,1,"Sensitive, acne prone, and very dehydrated. Pulling back on layers of hydration results in a lot of oil compensation and closed comedones. It‚Äôs a balancing act of trying to keep my skin hydrated and calm while also encouraging the cell turnover needed to keep pores clear."

1593884408.0,50,"Melano cc! There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs an HG for many people on this sub. Tons of reviews on it already but for me, it‚Äôs the only vit C product which has visibly improved my skin in a relative short time frame (I‚Äôve tried OST, Klairs, Wishtrend, Glossier, TO). My old PIH have faded noticeably, new acne scars aren‚Äôt as red. The packaging is also genius, don‚Äôt really have to worry about oxidation I find!"
1593885052.0,9,"Wishtrend! Its the most effective thing for my skin. I wish the melano cc worked for me like others as I like the packaging and how it doesn't oxidize, but it did nothing for me."
1593906892.0,4,"Shark Sauce in the Great White Shark variety! Vitamin C, niacinamide, licorice, and sea kelp!"
1593909442.0,4,"Neogen real vita C powder! I mix it into my toner in the morning. Nice for traveling and you don‚Äôt have to worry about it oxidizing. It is grainy unless you let it sit in your liquidy product for a couple of minutes. I have pretty hearty skin for vitamin C though - for sensitive skin, encapsulated vitamin C may be better. (Also Melano CC for sure! )"
1593906450.0,3,I've been using klairs vit drop! So far I've found it helps lighten my belmishes and helps with texture
1593899011.0,2,has anyone tried the Rhoto C serum? i don‚Äôt have experience with vitamin c and want to start with something affordable and effective. i‚Äôm 27 and am starting to see a tiny bit of sun damage and want something brightening.
1593912023.0,1,"Innisfree Brightening Pore Serum! It helped my acne scars fade away to faintly visible within a month, plus it has hyaluronic acid which helps with hydration."
1593919308.0,1,"I have sensitive skin so I cant handle pure vitamin c . I found this amazing substitute called Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening Serum. It contains a lot of vitamins, not just vitamin c due to the sea buckthorn. Also has niacinamide too :)

 perfect for sensitive skin!"
1593922176.0,1,"Melano CC was kinda meh for me, but  2sol Facial Recovery Booster is delivering. Its also go 10% niacinamide and Panthenol so I'm killing multiple birds with one stone."
1593937210.0,1,"i really want to try out the Melano cc but im still currently using PURITO vitamin C serum. Thoughts of Purito's one is when i first started using it oh damn my acne scars on my face really lighten. It has really helped me slowly but surely improve acne scars and dark spots. One thing that you might not like about the PURITO one is that is has a strong and not very pleasant smell. There is no fragrance in the formulation, so it has a somewhat strange smell, when i started using i was really put off by it, but as time goes im slowly getting used to it."
1593953402.0,1,"Melano CC works great as a spot treatment but I don't like it on my entire face.

Other than that, not into AB Vit C's, as all seem to have EOs. Favorite so far is Nufounatin C20+ Ferulic sold on Amazon. Made fresh."
1593901284.0,-8,AB doesn't make good vitamin c serums. I would recommend formulas with published studies of efficacy such as skinceuticals or timeless
1593910553.0,9,This didn‚Äôt work for me. Read quite a number of reviews that this causes breakout so tried avoiding it but saw it on sale 2 months ago in a local store so tried it. Tried on some spots to see what‚Äôs the rave about. Gave 3 days gap on each usage to slowly intro to my routine. Only used it twice and my face say no bro. This is the first product for me that causes breakout.
1593886555.0,7,THIS. I love Melano CC
1593892437.0,7,I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe how well it works compared to the many other (even more expensive!) brands I‚Äôve tried.
1593907051.0,5,"I just started using it two weeks ago and the glow is real.

I used to use TO 20% but I hated the texture so much I rarely used it. So maybe I will finally see some results with actual consistent use. I like the Yusuf scent too and the oily texture lets it sink it quickly after washing my face."
1593909262.0,3,Hi! I‚Äôm wondering which product you use? I‚Äôm just hearing about this and when I look it up it seems like there‚Äôs a lotion and essence
1593935306.0,1,"100% this! I love melano cc, helps reduce scarring marks from acne. Also  im based in singapore and the type that is available in stores here has alcohol in it, which is not effective for me at all! So make sure to check the ingredients before purchasing."
1593887347.0,4,It dint work for me .. dint see any improvement at all after 6 months too.. now changed to timeless vitamin c 2 weeks back. Seems to be good so far but would be good to wait for few more
1593895794.0,3,Good point! Products work differently for different people! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1593903984.0,1,Do you use the 21.5% or the 15%+ Ferulic Acid+Niacinamide one?
1593909814.0,2,Make sure you don't take so long to finish the bottle because it oxidizes so easily in our climate. I wasted half a bottle. Huhu. I think buying the smaller size is wiser?
1593911120.0,1,I feel you on that... you want it to work for you as well as it did for others but your skin just says nope üò¢ But you won‚Äôt know how it works for you until you try!
1593910962.0,8,It‚Äôs the essence that most talk about! Look for the thin silver tube!
1593911224.0,2,"I was the exact opposite! Tried Timeless 20% for over 6 months without results, but saw noticeable improvements with Melano CC in a number of weeks. Heads up that the Timeless is STRONG, and it may take some time to work up to daily use."
1593904031.0,2,The 21.5%.
1593944502.0,1,"I‚Äôve had mine for over a year and it still hasn‚Äôt oxidised!! I keep the bottle inside the original box in the fridge. 

A lot of people don‚Äôt keep it in the box but I think that‚Äôs important because I read that the light from the fridge can cause it to oxidise quicker"
1593911224.0,1,I've only started using it for two months I think? So haven't seen anything strange. But thank youu will kept that in mind. I found that happened to my niacinamide from the ordinary
1593938887.0,1,I have it for almost 2 months and a half now and it has the same colour and consistency. I keep it in the fridge and I don't use it so often now that it's warmer. Maybe once a week. But I used it 2-3 times a week when it was colder and  I guess because I didn't open it so often little air got in and it was better preserved. Also the fridge part.

1593927349.0,16,"For what it's worth, I think the reason people with basic routines have good skin is because people who have naturally good skin wouldn't have elaborate routines in the first place. I hope that made sense?

1593788982.0,30,"33F - UK based

**Skin Type:** dry/very dry skin

**Skin Concerns:** overall dry skin due to tret

**Skin Goals:** Hydrated, bouncy, firm, glowy skin

I get all my asian skincare on Yesstyle. I try to stick to fragrance free and alcohol free skincare as much as I can.

**Routine AM**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash -**    a very, creamy and hydrating face wash. Removes any leftover oil    cleanser and remaining makeup I may have on my face. Simple and    effective, been using this for years now and buy in bulk from Holland    & Barrett.

**Purito Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence -**    this is my fourth re-buy! It's really very hydrating and has   noticeable   brightening effects. The texture is slightly thick - it   does not run   through my fingers so it's not watery. I just press it   into my skin  before applying the emulsion. It's really a very good   essence!

**The Plant Base Nature Solution Hydrating Bamboo Emulsion -** a nice layer of dewy moisture as a prep to the rest, which is exactly what my skin needs.

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream -**    super dewy and super moisturising, holds really well under my   concealer  as well. Slightly sticky texture and has some fragrance in it   but it's  the last ingredient on the list and is not overpowering at   all.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream -**    I use the same moisturiser day and night as I have very dry skin due   to  using tret for anti-ageing purposes. This one is a dream I want to   it  eat it. It's truly hydrating and has the most gorgeous texture.  Dewy   finish.

**Canmake    Tokyo Mermaid UV Gel SPF50 PA++++ or Purito Green Level Unscented Sun    SPF50 PA++++ or Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Moisture Cream SPF 30 -**    I alternate between the three sunscreens depending of whether I'm    inside (SPF 30), outside dry day (Purito) or outside humid day    (Canmake). All three sunscreens are broad spectrum, fragrance and    alcohol free and no white cast. All three have semi-dewy and dewy    finishes, zero white cast. I'm tanned/medium brown so I love these.

**Routine** **PM**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil -**    a thick yet runny enough oil specific for dry skin. Easily removes    makeup and sunscreen and lathers into milk. Washes off clean and leaves    no residue.

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream**

**A-Ret Gel 0.025% -**    gel form, spreads nicely on skin and works wonders. I've been using    retinols for a long time and started using tret last year for    anti-ageing. The upgrade is serious and my skin is like glass with this    bad boy.

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream**

**On No Tretinoin Routine PM:**

**Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil**

**Dr. Organic  Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Face Wash**

**REN Ready Steady Glow AHA Tonic -**    contains some fragrance but again low on the ingredients list. I    saturate cotton pad and press it in all over my face and neck. I use the    leftover on my legs, helped with my strawberry leg a ton and my legs    are all glowy I kid you not! Has mild exfoliating properties which  helps   with my flakes from the tret. Skin is all a-glow!

**The Plant Base Nature Solution Hydrating Bamboo Emulsion**

**Scinic Snail Matrix Eye Cream**

**Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream**"
1593790766.0,12,"How do you manage to minimize the irritation when using tret and the Ren AHA? I use tret too and I wanna add an exfoliant so bad, but I‚Äôm scared of damaging my moisture barrier"
1593792000.0,7,How did you reduce the irritation from Ren? I have eczema so I have dry and sensitive skin but man this would irritate my skin for a few minutes idk if that‚Äôs normal
1593800088.0,4,Does the canmake sunscreen lean more to the matte or dewy side? I currently use the purito unscented spf and thats a dewy finish
1593803536.0,3,Have you thought about putting the tretinoin on after your moisturizer to reduce dryness? I heard that‚Äôs quiet popular.
1593792933.0,2,"love the purito fermented complex essence too! it's a really nice texture and not irritating for my oily comedogenic-prone skin at all :) one of my best finds from online shopping during lockdown, lol"
1593788903.0,1,Thoughts on the Sukin cream?
1593796319.0,1,Although I‚Äôm located in US wanted to know where do you purchase your A-retinol from ?
1593796820.0,1,"Oh, I really want to try the Dr. Organic face wash, Scinic eye cream, and Sukin night cream. I'm always trying to find very moisturizing, fragrance free skincare."
1593799373.0,1,Is the Sukin cream really good ?
1593804990.0,1,Can I ask where you got the can make and Purito sunscreens from please?? I‚Äôm moving to the UK in the next few months and want to make sure I can get them :)
1593806123.0,1,I have been eyeing the **Sukin Rosehip Enriching Night Cream** .  I was waiting for reviews to try it.  Sounds like you really like it.
1593820029.0,1,Did you have to get the A Ret gel 0.025% prescribed to you?
1593817334.0,2,I have REN and wow I‚Äôm definitely gonna try it on my legs also.
1593799180.0,5,"I don't use tret every night. One night I use tret, and one night I use REN. I need it because my skin flakes with the tret. However, I believe the REN is gentle enough for daily use on its own, so I doubt it would wreck your skin barrier if you follow with a good serum, moisturiser etc. I normally finish my REN night routines with a face oil as an occlusive too. Other than the tret flakes from time to time, my skin is super healthy and bouncy."
1593798595.0,5,"I would avoid that Ren toner if you have eczema because I do and used it once a day for 3 days straight and I got the worst skin irritation. It was bumpy, itchy and irritated for awhile and my skin is still textured from it. And I never get eczema on my face! My derm told me to use cortisone cream to fix it. 10/10 would not recommend"
1593799017.0,2,Yes I do get slight tingly/prickly feeling on my skin for a few seconds but it goes away after that. I even feel it when I apply it on my legs haha! My skin is more dry than sensitive though so maybe it's a bit worse for you? :(
1593802270.0,3,I would say a semi-dewy finish. More like a 'natural' skin finish.
1593804056.0,2,"Yes I used to do that and I also used to mixed the tret with my moisturiser and then apply it on. But I built up tolerance over the years and now apply it straight to my skin and just buffer it with moisturiser on top after five minutes. My skin is not crazy flaky anymore, it's past that point but it still flakes from time to time so I just gotta keep on top of it."
1593798946.0,2,It's so good and totally underrated!
1593789004.0,1,Sorry forgot to include my review in comments!
1593798874.0,10,From alldaychemist.com they ship worldwide
1593796830.0,3,You can use curology in the US. I just get it from my primary physician and my insurance covers it. If you‚Äôve got a doctor available it‚Äôs worth it to ask because curology is pretty expensive
1593798918.0,1,They are all stellar. That Sukin cream OMG the dream. The Scinic eye cream is gorgeous but does have a little fragrance in it!
1593802328.0,1,It is SO good. I just bought five more jars from iHerb haha I'm so extra.
1593805116.0,1,"I bulk buy them on Yesstyle but I believe they ship almost worldwide. UK has free shipping for all orders over ¬£60. You can also get them on eBay, sometimes for cheaper but sometimes for more so I always double check before I place my next order. Welcome to the UK :)"
1593849386.0,1,I have very dry skin and this feels very hydrating and so pleasant to apply. Nothing harsh in it and no fragrance but smells lovely too.
1593849233.0,1,No I buy it in bulk on alldaychemist.com
1593849264.0,1,"Yes I thought ""why not"" and liking the results!"
1593799267.0,2,Yeah I tend to only use it once and week thinking my skin would get used to it. Never did :(
1593799286.0,2,Probably lol. You live and you learn in this example hahhaag
1593839359.0,2,Now im going to buy it! Thanks OP
1593798893.0,1,Thank you :)
1593797032.0,4,Yes I‚Äôve been using Curology for past 3 years and my skin has gone from night to day . Now that they allow you to manage your shipment date I‚Äôll usually order big bottle every 3 months. Trying to be a little stingy here but this shipment rate works for me. I don‚Äôt have a doctor for skin and was wondering If this cream was available over the counter in US. Thanks :)
1593805750.0,1,I‚Äôm curious how you get it from your physician as it‚Äôs a private company with their own doctors. I have never seen language on their site about that option unless it was just recently added. Curology isn‚Äôt an option for everyone unfortunately ... Something in the base cream disagrees with my skin ‚òπÔ∏è but it works well for my daughter.  üôÇ I‚Äôm curious about the gel option though so I‚Äôll have to put that on the list of questions for my annual physical!
1593799634.0,2,Whyyyyy do they do that? My eyeballs do not need to be perfumed. No-one is going to sniff them.
1593807657.0,1,Thanks so much! The yesstyle shipping fees to Canada end up being so much more than the cost of the sunscreen and all I want to do is try Purito! Canmake is my go to right not but looking to add more for different days like yourself. Thanks for the help!
1593902324.0,1,Thank you.  This helps
1593797634.0,2,You cannot get tret without a prescription in the United States
1593806535.0,3,I don‚Äôt use curology anymore. I see my doctor who gave me a prescription for tret that I pick up from the pharmacy for $5. It‚Äôs a better option for me cost wise though obviously insurance coverages vary so it may not be as affordable for everyone
1593802295.0,1,"Ugh I know, but I was surprised it even had perfume in it cause I can't smell anything!"
1593849318.0,1,Do you not have a minimum order to buy for free shipping? I just buy extra essences and emulsions to get to ¬£60 as I know I will use all of these anyway.
1593797728.0,4,Ahhh.. my Curology prescription has 0.009% tret  with 1% azelic acid and 9% clindamycin and that formula keeps my skin clear. I‚Äôll stick to Curology for now. Thanks :)
1593807610.0,1,Ahhhh that makes sense - how it was worded made me think you were getting *curology* from your doctor but you‚Äôre getting just tret - got it!
1593863773.0,1,"They just announced free shipping on orders of $185, someone in another sub confirmed it was because of covid. Looks like I'm going with ebay!"
1593871819.0,1,Blimey. Hopefully it gets better after Covid. Used to be minimum ¬£30 for UK before the virus.

1593826939.0,50,"I've used both, but I sincerely believe that there isn't a lot of meaningful difference between a toner/serum/essence/ampoule. Technically the labels can indicate things like texture, viscosity, or concentration of ingredients, but it's all really wishy-washy as there are no labelling rules and there is a lot of crossover between products in these ""categories"". I don't really pay attention to the product name and focus instead on the ingredients and what I want those ingredients to do.   

So, for example, if I want to incorporate niacinamide into my routine, I look for products that have 4-5% niacinamide and then look at things like price per mL, texture, other ingredients instead of focusing on whether or not I am looking for a toner or essence."
1593826822.0,16,"The names are super arbitrary. If I want some panthenol in my routine it makes no difference if that panthenol is coming from a toner or an essence. I don't care about the arbitrary marketing terms. I only look at ingredients. Both toners and essences are watery layers that can deliver some beneficial ingredients into the skin. The ingredients I look for in a toner/essence: Amino Acids, Licorice Root, Centella Asiatica, Green Tea and Aloe Vera.

Essences are marketed as being more concentrated than toners, (and serums are marketed as being more concentrated than both) but I haven't found that to be the case at all.

For example, the 2sol Cica Youth Toner contains 10% panthenol. I haven't found a single serum, let alone an essence, that contains that much panthenol. Even the Cos de Baha Panthenol serum (a panthenol centric serum) contains only 4% panthenol.

Another example, the Cos de Baha Niacinamide Toner contains 5% Niacinamide, whereas the CosRx Galactomyces Essence contains only 2%.

So in summary, names don't matter. Ingredients and concentrations thereof are the only things that matter.

I also take issue with the identification of essences as being more viscous than toners, which is sometimes how they are differentiated. I've used toners that are more viscous than essences and I've used essences that are more watery than toners.

All that being said, my favorite essences are Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence, Neogen Real Ferment Micro Essence and Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose Edition.

My favorite toners are 2sol Cica Youth Toner, Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, Benton Deep Green Tea Toner and Isntree Aloe Soothing Toner."
1593823428.0,6,"I like using the SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner from Etude House (sometimes more than 1 layer of it patted on the face) and the fermented mugwort essence from Missha when my skin needs some extra hidration. But I don't really use them together.

I also have one of the hyped toners from Biologique Recherche - it was recomended to me by a esthetician that works exclusively with this brand, but I've never used is often enough to check if it really forks for me.

&#x200B;

Also, Leah Yoo on skincare stuff we don't really need:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqpILzHqgJ8) She explains what toners and essences are"
1593822014.0,8,"I have and use both.

My skin type was combo oily, but it's basically normal now (slightly acne prone).

My skin adores the extra hydration. I usually layer on 3 - 4 watery toners/essences with varying ingredients and purposes. But for me, skincare is more about relaxing and enjoying my time than just another necessary step in hygiene, like brushing my teeth or something. 

Current HG is the Utena Magiabotanica Hatomugi Skin Conditioner. I spritz this on multiple times throughout my routine just because. Very lightweight, hydrating, and mildly soothing. 

Other favorites: 

- Siorus Time Is Running Out Mist, I love this one almost as much as the Magiabotanica. I will often use it with just sunscreen afterwards on very lazy mornings. 

- Primera Miracle Seed Essence, new favorite. My skin was already in good shape and this product managed to make it better.

- I'm From Rice Toner, I've been a bit neglectful with it lately, which still means using it nearly every night but only some mornings. Amazing texture and a lovely brightening effect."
1593823787.0,3,"I‚Äôve been using only an essence + serum + moisturizer since the start of quarantine and my skin has actually been really happy. I usually use 2 layers of essence when I have more time (let it soak in more). I‚Äôm finishing up the May coop one and then I‚Äôm going to go back to the innisfree soybean energy essence, which I already finished off a bottle of.

I have combo skin and used to use both (plus other steps) and I think my skin just does better with less steps."
1593844014.0,3,"I use both. I have dry dehydrated skin so I like using as much as I can. If I had to pick one, I'd choose essence. I really love the Cosrx Snail Mucin essence. It makes my skin hydrated and plump. I currently use the I'm From Rice Toner and it's moisturizing and also sinks into my skin. I want to test the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner next and see how it compares to the I'm From one which I love."
1593860724.0,2,Depends on what you use afterwards. If you are going to use serum or moisturizer afterwards then toner will do. If not then it's better to use essence. Essence is more concentrated version of toner.
1593853657.0,1,"I have and use both. I have combination oily skin with breakouts on my red days which usually leave dark spots.

My favorite hydrating toners are the unscented klairs supple prep toner and the aromatica hyaluronic acid toner. I use 3 layers of my toner and apply each layer after the first layer is absorbed. I find that this method makes my skin smoother and plumper in the morning.
For essences my favorite is the Nacific Niacin essence, I like using niacinamide in my routine but I don‚Äôt like the tacky feeling I get from niacinamide serums and this one really faded my dark spots fast.

I think that using both won‚Äôt hurt but you have to find essences that work for your skin and your needs because some essences have the same ingredients with some toners. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1593868928.0,1,Both but I treat my toner as fancy water.
1593828873.0,9,"Yeah I agree. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to ask ‚Äútoner or essence‚Äù because different toners/essences have different properties, and hence everyone has a difference idea of toners/essences. There‚Äôs no standard so it‚Äôd be more helpful to reference what properties you‚Äôre looking at instead, e.g. watery, more viscous, ingredient concentration."
1593843635.0,3,Just curious what results you get with the 2sol toner? And is it sticky with that much panthenol in it?
1593847276.0,2,"2nd this. Ive jumped on the hype trend of 1st essences, toners, essences and after stacking them one after another in a routine, honestly its just a hydration layer that you need. If your skin is saying you dont need so many layers then you dont, simple as that. (Which is what my skin told me) So now I'm left with 4 toners and 3 essences that I'm trying to finish using one at a time, struggle is real üòÇ"
1593865696.0,1,I have the Benton deep green tea toner right now and I'm really enjoying it. Only thing I hesitated with when getting this was lack of preservatives but caved in the end because it did sound like an anti-inflammatory dream! The Isntree Aloe soothing toner is on my list to try too.
1593877720.0,1,"Do you think the keep cool and soothe bamboo toner would be suitable for a dry/air conditioned environment? Tried to get my hands on the 2sol toner but because of covid, it's near impossible :("
1593891188.0,3,"It's not sticky at all surprisingly! Mostly robust hydration, meaning, long lasting ""deep"" hydration (unlike Hyaluronic Acid, for example, which doesn't impart long lasting hydration for me at all.) Also plumping and moisture barrier maintenance. But my favorite thing is that it's super hydrating while being basically weightless on the skin.."
1593874627.0,1,"Are you me??!!  :) :) I have all sorts of stuff to finish before I am allowing myself to restock/try stuff (wallet cries silently in the corner) and when I layer them one by one, my skin looks a baby which is full but is still being fed boiled carrots and is about to throw an angry fit!!"
1593866011.0,3,Ya I really really wish Benton formulated with preservatives. But there's something about that toner though! I couldn't stop reaching for it..and it's so affordable.
1593866687.0,3,"Isntree Aloe is more hydrating I think üôÇ just so you know. Actually Isntree Aloe is just as hydrating as Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, which I thought was the most hydrating waterweight toner until now. I LOVE it."
1593888501.0,1,"Yes. The Keep Cool is very hydrating, but depending on your skin you might need to layer.

Are you sure you can't get 2sol?

https://www.ebay.com/itm/183543484360

(It was $22 when I purchased.)

You can also get it here with free worldwide shipping.

https://bestbeautip.com/products/183543484360"
1593869792.0,1,"Okay that actually sounds really good, thanks for the feedback, don't really see anyone else talking about it üôÇ yeah the Benton isn't that hydrating but it's okay for the summer months, feels kind of refreshing so I don't mind it for now."
1593890633.0,1,"A different ebay seller I was in contact with stated it would be extra shipping cost and they didn't know how long it would get here. I'll have to check out the 2 sites you linked. Out of keep cool and 2sol, which do you think is better for hydrating skin? My skin can be sensitive and prone to redness. I've tried other toners and essences that seem to have only a short time of hydrating my skin and some I think made my skin drier no matter the method I was applying them: Klairs Supple Toner, I'm From Mugwort Essence, Acwell Licorice Toner, and Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence.Thanks so much for your input :)"
1593890805.0,1,"Are you applying moisturizer after essence and toner?

I think the 2sol is more hydrating but the Keep Cool is more soothing. Also I love Keep Cool because it's EXTREMELY versatile. It can be used anywhere in the routine for added hydration."
1593891201.0,1,"Yes I've been applying them right after moisturizer. I've tried light and heavier moisturizers too with no avail. My skin is hydrated after but then within an hour or two, my skin feels tight and flaky. I bought the LRP Lipikar Balm based on your recommendations and my skin is still flaky. I'm trying not to add too many steps to my routine, but I think an essence, toner, or serum will help with the hydration piece since moisturizers aren't really made for that. Appreciate your input!"

1593839339.0,3,"**skincare**

‚Ä¢ green tea seed serum: a basic hydrating serum,  there are probably better ones out there; but it feels so instantly cooling and refreshing, and also worked wonders on refining the appearance of pore and sebaceous filaments on my dehydrated skin. there is a pretty distinct fragrance, though.

‚Ä¢ volcanic pore clay mask: super gentle, comfortable mask that doesn't dry out my skin; it definitely takes consistent use, but it's so inexpensive and lasts long. using a thin layer a couple times a week gently clears and smooths skin in the long run.

‚Ä¢ my real squeeze sheet masks: they have a huuuge range and are pretty inexpensive, i especially like the honey, pomegranate, oatmeal, and rice ones.

‚Ä¢ personally ive never tried this before, but my super oily, acne-prone friend swears by their sunscreens

**makeup**

‚Ä¢ eyeshadow singles: ugh i love their eyeshadows. the mattes are smooth and pigmented (by asian beauty standards), definitely on the dry side but not too powdery; but the glitters are my favourite: they vary in intensity but are all stunning. you can also buy one of their little magnetic palettes to slot your singles into.

‚Ä¢ twinkle glitter liners: they're fine, they're nice. small tipped, full pigmentation, an intense shimmer that dries down nicely. it amps up any look effortlessly.

‚Ä¢ eyeliners: the always new auto liner was kinda dry on my eyes, didn't like that one much, but their gel liners are pretty smooth and pigmented! i wish the tip was a little thinner, but that's just personal preference.

‚Ä¢ microcara: formula is okay, dry type of mascara, but the wand is what makes it so special. it is perfect for if you have tragic lower lashes (like me) or if you want a very natural and defined lash look. i saved the wand and use it with other mascaras when mine dried up. i use the skinny longlongcara. it also comes in a smaller tube!

‚Ä¢ blushes: not my favourite, but they're nice, basic, buildable blushes for that veil effect. soft smooth powder, they also have a cream formula; in a nice range of wearable colours. pretty matte, though. but i like the pan blushes better than their liquid ones, which are a bit too natural for me.

‚Ä¢ vivid cotton ink: super pigmented, soft velvet; can be worn opaque in one swipe, or blotted down to a sheer flush that won't transfer, which is my favourite aspect of it - the formula is so manipulable like that, and it's so creamy that its perfect for mixing colours. blends nicely on the eyes and cheeks. beautiful colour range too. not drying if you prep your lips beforehand. doesn't have a traditional stain. pretty strongly scented, but fades on application.

‚Ä¢ i think discontinued so i'll keep this short, but the creamy vivid tints: juicy but thin, glossy, long-lasting stain, gorgeous colours, i cri, bring them back innisfree

‚Ä¢ i don't usually use loose powders, but they're no-sebum mineral powder is very mattifying."
1593819580.0,3,I really love their lip balms! Particularly the canola honey lip balm
1593821583.0,3,"Volcanic clay mask, so soothing and refreshing."
1593825985.0,3,"I like the Minimum Serum for Sensitive Skin (it's been renamed to Gentle Care for US region). It has 8 ingredients, no fragrance, and feels quite hydrating without being sticky or greasy. It's a *boring* product (lol) but one that I use pretty often when my skin is feeling sensitized or when it's feeling dehydrated.



Their Green Tea Seed Serum is very popular but it unfortunately did not work for me. I actually did like the scent but a lot of people hate it (it's pretty strong tbh). It was lightweight and gave me a matte finish, but I broke out in whiteheads and PIE from it. I was pretty sad about it."
1593820984.0,5,"Their clay masks are very popular. I liked their lipsticks too. Just ordered the new fruit tint thing. The blurring powder was pretty decent, I used up a tub of the loose powder and am now onto the pressed. Eyeshadow can be hit or miss, I really like an old formula from a few years ago but not their recent stuff. The blueberry watery sun cream has one of the nicest finishes I've tried from a Korean sunscreen. 

Edit: their green tea stuff smells nasty. It's the same smell as a lot of cheap Korean ""green"" products, including the saem harakeke line. I wouldn't buy it without sniffing it first."
1593819511.0,2,"Love all their mists. Canola honey lip balm is also great, as is the fermented soybean oil"
1593821775.0,2,"I use their Matte Mineral Setting Powder on my hair as a dry shampoo, it does a wonderful job in decreasing the oiliness of it's appearance.

Hydrating Green Tea Cleanser was pretty gentle on my face and the price point was reasonable. Their oil cleansers get the job done as long as you don't mind it being heavily fragranced.

The Green tea seed serum as well, does its job, nothing too exciting there.

Recently I've been in love with their hand creams, especially the Dawn Hoji Cha scent, smells just like milk tea.

Overall, lots of good products but nothing exceptionally wow-ing. I can count on it to not break me out or strip my skin during cleansing though!"
1593839264.0,2,"\- Auto eyebrow pencil. It's cheap and lasts forever. The color's good too. 

\- No sebum mineral powder. Cheap and effective.

\- Green tea seed serum. I've actually stopped using this, but it was all right, if strongly fragranced. 

\- Super volcanic pore clay mask. Came back to this after trying out the Missha one (also partially because there was a BTS BT21 box set)."
1593831216.0,3,"Used to love innisfree. It's one of the brands from my earlier AB Journey. I liked Jeju Orchid Enriched Eye Cream, and Cream, the Volcanic Clay Mask, and their sheetmasks also good.

But now that I'm in the journey to fragrance and essential oils-free, I cut innisfree out of my regimen. Because it's a brand that loves putting fragrance and eo in the products, each line has either one or both."

1593820533.0,1,"I love their lip gloss, cant remember the name but it's all named after tea... smells amazing and is just enough color. I use their orchid face lotion as well, smells really strong but my skin loves it."
1593821505.0,1,"It's a great brand for those starting out in skincare. My brother has oily acne prone skin, and he uses the clarifying skincare set. And I enjoyed their makeup, esp the skinnycara, when I was a teen. It wasn't pricy and wasn't too difficult to use. My current faves are their clay mask and their Orchid cream."

I know that a lot of teenage Korean girls are obsessed with the brand though (my experience from doing an exchange to Korea, when announced that there was an Innisfree shop nearby, they all freaked out)."
1593845023.0,1,"I recently got the Olive Real cleanser, and like it a lot as my first cleanser step. I had the Klairs Gentle Black oil cleanser before that. The Innisfree one feels less oily, and I like how it makes my skin feel better than the Klairs one."
1593845276.0,1,"Some of the products are definitely too heavy and has caused me to break out a few times since my skin might just be too sensitive. 

However, my favourite product is definitely the valcano exfoliater. The greentea cleanser is also really nice as well for once a day use. 

One of the most overrated products for me was the green tea serum which caused me to break out badly :("

Im iffy about probiotics in skincare(does it even work wtf) but the blend of squalane, cermaide, cholesterol and green tea in this bad boy keeps tret dryness at baaaay.

My mom loooves the orchid line. She finds it super moisturizing for her dry and mature skin."
1593877848.0,1,"Their sunscreens in the long lasting and mild formula are some of my favorite sunscreens. I prefer mild formula over the long lasting though bc the long lasting formula caused some small breakouts. Their no sebum powder is also nice, minimal scent. I want to try their bija cica cream."
1593949852.0,1,I love their Cherry Blossom Dewy Glow Mist!! It‚Äôs smells like candy but the scent is so faint and I believe it‚Äôs fragrance free (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). I don‚Äôt know how dewy and glowy it makes you tbh but it moisturizes my skin throughout the day and doesn‚Äôt make me feel greasy or immediately dry my skin out which is what I typically feel in other facial mists.

1593824670.0,1,"Oh i see, i hope they haven‚Äôt discontinued the blueberry line!! :("
1593872021.0,3,"Hi!

It's not! I'd say look for cleansers of a pH ranging from 5 to 6 with 5.5 being ideal.

The human skin has a pH of 5.5 so it is considered ideal for cleansers to be of the same pH so as to not strip the skin too much. I've heard good things about innisfree blueberry pH5.5 cleanser.
My personal favourite is heimish all clean green foam pH5.5!

There are many pH balanced cleansers in the market, always check the pH prior to purchasing the product! This goes for all cleansers except for oil/balm cleansers as oils don't have a pH.

Hope this helps!"
1593863361.0,1,"I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I think the blueberry line is a South Korea exclusive which is why it isn‚Äôt listed on the international website. I got my cleansers in the physical store in Korea (bought two and used it up already) but can‚Äôt find it in any physical store here. 

Best bet would be to buy from third party sellers like roseroseshop or jolse. Or Shopee if you‚Äôre from South East Asia like me :)"

1593907588.0,1,"A few days ago a bunch of large red blotches appeared all over my face (cheeks, forehead, and nose except for my eyes) but I didn't notice it until two days ago, I've been trying not to look in the mirror too much to not be obsessive about my skin.

My mom said that it's probably an allergic reaction to one of the products I've been using, but I've been keeping the same routine for the past half year or longer.

* Cerave foaming facial cleanser
* Krave Great Barrier Relief + SoonJung 2x barrier intensive cream (I started using this two weeks ago after not using it for a few months)
* Melano CC (in the morning)
* [Acne.org](https://acne.org/) Benzoyl peroxide (in the morning)
* Tretinoin 0.05% (at night)
* Sunscreen: UV Aqua Super Moisture Milk (I just started using a new bottle a few days before this happened)

My skin has definitely been pretty dry and sensitive, probably due to the tret I'm on, although it's already been a year since I've gone on it (it's helped somewhat but I still get frequent breakouts unfortunately), so I only use the BP two or three times a week on my breakouts.

Anyways, have any of you experienced something like this? I don't think it makes sense that it would be an allergic reaction considering I've been using the same products for a while now, and my neck also suddenly got really dry and itchy even though I don't use products on it (I know I should). But, there is a clear border around my face and my eyes where the redness ends, as if I was wearing a red face mask.

1593910432.0,1,"Kinda sounds like some sort of contact allergy- not necessarily from one of your products, but perhaps something inadvertently got on your hands before you touched your face/neck. I haven‚Äôt had that happen to my face, but I‚Äôve definitely had it happen elsewhere- not just from obvious things like touching plants either. One time I carried groceries from costco from the car in one of the cardboard boxes they have available...the inside of my forearms got super red, blotchy and itchy! Apparently one of the dyes or chemicals on the box was not something my skin could tolerate even for a couple of minutes.

If you can‚Äôt recall touching anything unusual, I would say maybe just monitor for another few days and see if it improves. If it‚Äôs getting worse, then discontinue anything potentially irritating at least for a couple of days and just use moisturizer/stay out of the sun. It‚Äôs ok to take a day or two off of tret if your skin is angry, and give your skin a break to heal. If it still doesn‚Äôt improve, I would seek advice from your dermatologist."

Last Friday they sent me an automated mail that Standard shipping ($2,50) to Germany is back and I promptly put in another order, as I‚Äôm running really dry on supplies, but since then nothing has moved I‚Äôm starting to get a bit antsy of more stuff sitting there for months and better sales on other websites coming and going (again), which would be especially frustrating now that the shipping is paid.

I also like Barry M dewy finish setting spray, contains polyvinylpyrrolidone which is a great film former so I feel like it keeps my sunscreen in place (doesn‚Äôt do anything to mattify though so I use it on top of the By Terry powder). Not sure if it‚Äôs available outside the U.K. but I‚Äôm sure any setting spray with PVP would do. I‚Äôm sure Labmuffin has a video on which ingredients to look out for in setting sprays"
1593896353.0,1,Lots of people I follow apply the color science SPF powder over there makeup/previous sunscreen with little disturbance. I am reassured that my SPF isn‚Äôt moving by allowing 10ish minutes for the sunscreen to settle into my skin before applying the powder. Plus nothing is left on my brush after application so I don‚Äôt think anything‚Äôs moving.

I‚Äôve been using Round Labs Mugwort Calming Toner ( soothing and hydrating ) as a final step rather than topping it my usual more hydrating products. In the AM I just splash with water, vitamin C, round lab toner, tinted sunscreen."

For skin dehydration I suggest layering your toner or essence. Use humid climate to your advantage, use hyalauronic acid! It pulls water from the environment to keep your skin hydrated."

The natural pigmentation of my lips are pretty dark, so something I struggle to find are products that give me that somewhat lighter blush/coral-y with the perfect translucent gloss. Similar things I've tried in the past just made me look *crazy*. The color would either be too light, or the texture is too goopy, and it just never looked natural.

But this is so pretty and easy to apply. The staying power is meh, it's the kind of thing you'd have to reapply a few hours later. But imo worth it given this is the first time I've achieved this kind of color on my lips"

1593698567.0,22,"i agree! i bought #04 nudy tender rose and #01 peach punch red sometime last year and i still use them often now! they're so nice and feel great on my lips. i initially thought peach punch red would be too light for me since my lips are also a bit dark, but it wasn't at all! they feel like creamy lip tints at first but over time, the water rises and it feels more like a lip oil without the oil? it's so different! the only issue is that it doesn't leave much of a tint after it's gone, but it's so pretty that i can't complain much even on that lol."
1593725493.0,4,Wow that's lovely. I want to try one of their tints now!

1593676727.0,173,Hahaha honestly your dedication to eliminating tour makeup routine is inspiring. How long does your semi permanent eyeliner / liptint last?
1593668408.0,211,"Hi all! Wanted to share my results after 3 years of not wearing makeup and 2 years of taking good care of my skin. I was really unhappy with my skin before (very textured, fine lines, uneven) and would wear foundation to hide it. Entering my early 30s inspired me to change my ways and I went makeup free. My friend introduced me to Korean 10 step skin care 2 years ago and that really made a positive impact on my skin. My only regret is not paying attention to skin care in my 20s!

Please note: Yes, I am 100% makeup free. I was serious about ditching makeup. I got semi-permanent eyeliner tattooed, eyebrows microbladed, lip blush tattooed. I was *really* sick of putting on makeup after 10 years of doing it daily. I haven't used foundation, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil or lipstick in years.

Here is the list of skin care products I'm currently using:

1) Oil-Based Cleanser: Innisfree Green Tea Cleansing Oil

2) Water-Based Cleanser: COSRX Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser

3) Exfoliator: Deciem Glycolic Acid (7%) Toning Solution (use only 1x/2days)

4) Toner: Issntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner 

5) Essence: Sulwahsoo First Care Activating Serum

6) Treatments: Deciem The Ordinary ""Buffet"" Serum

7) Sheet Mask: Any sheet mask from Innisfree or Mediheal

8) Eye cream: Deciem Hylamide SubQ Eyes

9) Moisturizer: Deciem The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA

10) Daytime Sunscreen: Neutrogena Hydro Boost SPF50
Nighttime Sleep Mask: Sulwahsoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask EX

I have to admit I'm a bit thrifty and I often swap out more expensive products (Sulwahsoo) with slightly less expensive (Innisfree). One day Sulwhasoo, another day Innisfree. It helps the expensive stuff last longer for me. Two things I absolutely adore and work so well for me: Deciem Glycolic Acid (7%) Toning Solution and Sulwahsoo Overnight Revitalizating Mask EX. The glycolic acid solution zaps my adult acne breakouts ASAP and putting on the Sulwahsoo night mask means in the morning I have plump glowing skin. Please note I'm not a skin expert, I just found a routine that works for me and wanted to share. Hope you all have a great skin day ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1593670734.0,26,Stunning results! Just wanted to know how to you use the glycolic acid? Spot treatment or full face?
1593675655.0,22,"Wow! I remember when Michelle Phan announced she no longer wears foundation. I feel this!!! Looks amazing! Oh also, would you say the hydra boost night cream would work for dry acne prone skin too? Is it scented? Thanks!"
1593673840.0,17,Amazing results! I have a couple of questions about the semi-permanent makeup if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. How long after you got the makeup tattooed was the photo on the right taken? And how much did the procedures cost? The makeup looks fantastic!
1593679052.0,13,You're 34?! Do you do anything for anti-aging?
1593673385.0,5,"Wow, thats amazing! You seriously just gave me so much hope on adjusting my makeup and face routine üòç"

1593678329.0,4,What does semi perm lip tiny entail? Is it similar to tattooing?
1593735838.0,3,I admire your dedication!! Your skin is glowing. ‚ú®May I ask what your skin type is?
1593696806.0,3,Your skin looks absolutely fantastic! I would have guessed you were early 20s if you hadn‚Äôt specified your age!
1593705368.0,3,"You look so good!!! Would you ever consider lash extensions?

I totally feel you on foundation btw. It was really hard for me to give it up, and I had refused to believe that stopping it would make my skin better.. but since I had to stay home due to 'rona, I stopped wearing it everyday.. and bam! My skin has gotten so much more even, less oily, less flaky, stopped breaking out as much, etc."
1593679363.0,2,Your skin looks incredible! Where do you find all these products in Canada?
1593691123.0,2,"so gorgeous!! someone i know got the semi-permanent eyeliner and she said it hurt a lot, how was ur experience? i haven't started using make up yet but love the idea of not having to bother with eyeliner"
1593692118.0,2,I saw that you said you‚Äôre Canadian and got lip tinting done for $200. Do you mind me asking if it was in the Ontario GTA area? Also was the lip tint put on darker or lighter shade lips? I‚Äôve been looking o to getting my lips tinted too because of hyperpigmentation on the top lip but I can‚Äôt book a consultation due to COVID restrictions still.
1593692210.0,2,good job
1593702189.0,2,OMG saving this asap... your skin looks AMAZING. Did you experience any hormonal acne in your 30s? I‚Äôm in my early 30s and experiencing hormonal acne now but had clear skin in my 20s :(
1593711831.0,2,Does lip blush mean you get your entire lips stained or just like the lip line you‚Äôd normally use a lip liner on?

1593733878.0,2,Beautiful
1593740982.0,2,I‚Äôm so curious on the lip tint and have been wanting to get mine done! How was the peeling? Are you getting it touched up every so often?
1593803632.0,2,Wow you go girl!!! Its my dream to completely eliminate makeup usage
1593710182.0,1,Do the circle lenses come in prescription only?
1593681344.0,1,Wow! Beautiful.. but what is eyebrow micro blading?
1593691297.0,-17,How can you be makeup free if you have eye make up on
1593678492.0,97,"I swear it's one of the best beauty decisions I made for myself. Saves *so* much time and no more raccoon eyes from smidgey liners. Semi-permanent liners typically last 1-2 years. With good skin care habits and well hydrated skin, it can last even longer. However, they do require touchups if some spots start fading."
1593682299.0,17,"I have always wondered, is cleansing oil only for removing makeup? Do you do both one after another since you don't use makeup now?"
1593708003.0,6,Deciem says not to use the Buffet & Glycolic acid in the same routine though ü§î has that been ok for you? I want to introduce peptides but been confused with Deciem's warnings about conflicts with AHAs :s
1593697345.0,2,How do you like the Hydroboost? I thought about getting it but it had a weird smell.
1593708593.0,2,"I love Sulwhasoo FCAS and Overnight Mask. I also have their Radiance Energy Mask. I tried their TimeTreasure overnight mask, but that one broke me out unfortunately."
1593712017.0,2,"Your skin looks fabulous!  I love to invest in a good skincare routine as it means having naturally glowing skin.  I luv your dedication to having great looking skin.

I really like masks.  Are there any other sleeping masks that you recommend?"
1593671419.0,21,Thank you!! Full face except my eye area. I have naturally oily pimple prone skin so full face exfoliation once every two days is a must to keep breakouts to a minimum. üëç
1593677539.0,19,"Thank you!! When i turned 30 I realized no matter how much foundation I put on, it didn't do anything to hide fine lines or rough, dehydrated skin texture. Just got so sick of hiding my skin. So for the 10th step, during the day I put on Neutrogena Hydro Boost sunscreen. I honestly love this sunscreen because it helps to seal in all of the hydrating serums and creams. It's lightly scented and leaves your skin glowing. As for the night time, instead of putting on sunscreen, I put on Sulwahsoo Revitalizing Mask. It works well to nourish and hydrate the skin at night while you sleep. It's lightly scented and smells of ginseng. What helped me with acne control is using the glycolic acid exfoliator once every 2 days. Hope this all helps!"
1593674692.0,52,"The after photo is about 2 years into having semi-permanent tattooing done. I get touched up once a year or so. I'm from Canada and the eyeliner was $400, microblading $350, lip blush $200. For me the time savings (saves me 30 mins every morning), being rain-proof and cry-proof made it totally worth it. Feel free to ask any other questions, super happy to answer."
1593679879.0,14,For me the entirety of 10 step skin care itself is anti-aging. Some of my major concerns were fine lines and sallow skin (both signs of aging). Those concerns basically disappeared as soon as I started making sure my skin is hydrated. I think as I get closer to my 40s I'll have look into more intensive anti-aging products.
1593689500.0,5,"Though not AB, The Ordinary's Buffet has helped me, who's around OP's age, with the anti-aging part - some of the fine lines and sallow skin that OP mentioned, and also toned down some stubborn redness around my nostrils. This is on top of an improved skin after finally dealing dehydration a couple of years ago."
1593673857.0,6,"It's so worth it! Not having to wear foundation was a total game changer for me. No more touchups, no more melting makeup, way less clogged pores, too!"
1593674875.0,6,Thank you so much! Really want to show everyone it's never too late to start taking better care of your skin. I have better skin now in my 30s than I ever did in my 20s.
1593678111.0,5,"Thank you very much! I try to do it twice a day but I have to admit i will skip the sheet mask if I'm pressed for time (which is pretty often). I feel like if you cheat a few times a week and reduce the steps it's totally ok too. On lazy days I might skip a cleanser, skip sheet mask and exfoliation. Still works out fine in the end üòÜ"
1593678940.0,10,Yup! Artists use a tattooing machine especially designed for semi-permanent makeup applications. It can hurt a little or a lot depending on the area being tattooed and pain tolerance. Tattoo artists will apply a numbing gel/cream to reduce discomfort. Good artists will also make sure they sketch out the shape first with lip liner so you can get the lip shape you desire. Always do your research and go with knowledgeable professionals!
1593737499.0,3,"Thank you!! Well hydrated skin glows from within, this was something people told me and I was too stubborn in my 20s to believe, but it's so true!! Before, when I neglected my skin, I had super oily skin that broke out a lot. My T-zone was so oily it didn't matter what primer or foundation I wore, the makeup would start sliding off mid day. Now with good skin care, I'm combination skin with a slightly oily T-zone and normal skin everywhere else on my face. Hydration totally changed my skin :)"
1593706122.0,5,"Girl let me tell you, I had eyelash extensions done every month for 2 years back when I was younger. It was really awesome at first and a huge thrill to actually have lashes. But after a while I just got tired of not being able to rub my eyes or sleep with my face in the pillow. I've come to terms with my itty bitty tiny lashes. Short lashes are ok for me! And congrats on having better skin, I hope you continue going makeup free past COVID! Enjoy that natural healthy glow :)"
1593680187.0,6,"They are available at Walmart and most of the larger Asian supermarkets carry Korean skin care products. If I can't find them there, I order from YesAsia. Shipping can be a total pain tho."
1593697034.0,2,"Out of all of the semi-permanent procedures, the eyeliner was the most painful by far. I have decently high pain tolerance but I still broke out in cold sweat from the pain. The artist reapplied numbing cream and it helped a little, but overall it was definitely not a comfortable 2.5 hours. Despite this, it was so worth it for me; my oily lids and teary eyes meant any eyeliner I've ever used *always* smudged a little. Drove me nuts! I used to have to pop into the bathroom throughout the day to check and fix racoon eyes. Those days are OVER :D"
1593698097.0,4,"I'm on the west coast in BC. I was really lucky to have found an experienced microblading and eyebrow tattooing artist who had just learned lip blush and was needing models & pictures of lip blush work for her portfolio. Usually lip blush would cost at least double the price, around $400 in my area. It was a risk to go with someone new to the technique, but her microblading and eyebrow tattooing portfolio was so impressive I decided to give her a try. She honestly did a really good job using light colors to reduce the look of brownish pigmentation around the border of my lips. I also requested an ombre effect with the center of the lip more intensely pigmented; it resulted in a more ""stained"" look, which was what I wanted. I know with some very darkly pigmented lips, the 1st appointment could be spent lightening those areas, then a 2nd appointment (after lips have healed) is needed to add color. Hope you get to have your tattoo soon!"
1593809380.0,1,"Thank you! Yes I do get hormonal acne right before my period, it's always concentrated around my jawline and lower cheeks, drives me nuts. I find pimple patches do a really good job getting them to shrink quickly and also heal quickly. I've tried COSRX pimple patches and they do wonders for me. I think with hormonal acne there's just no way to prevent it so the best option is to treat it quickly and shorten the duration. Someone please correct me if I'm mistaken!"
1593719523.0,2,"Likely many years, but it would gradually fade to a greyish color as the body breaks down the pigments and would look awful. I'm 10 months out from my last touchup and honestly the tattoo is still very dark. I'm guessing I could go 2 years without a touchup before it starting to look noticeably faded."
1593738204.0,1,Yessss. I did the math. I wore makeup nearly every day for 10 years and it would take 30 mins in the morning to put on my face. I've spent nearly 2000 hours over my life time putting stuff on my face that clogged my skin and dulled it! I turned 31 in 2017 and the thought of another 20+ years of wasting 30 mins a day doing makeup made me die a little inside. I hope you get your tattoos! You're going to love how awesome it is to just wake up looking put together <3
1593737614.0,2,Not a dumb question at all! Glycolic Acid is a pretty effective exfoliant and should only be used every other day. They really recommend against using it daily as it could cause irritation and redness when overused. Hope that helps!
1593743692.0,2,"I had it done to correct hyperpigmentation (darkness) around the border of my lips and a red tinted for a healthy natural look. Super highly recommend it. Now i just apply lip balm and good to go! The peeling was awful, not gonna lie. At one point i was telling my friends it's like i wet my lips and dipped them in a bag of panko breadcrumbs. Just weird bits of dry dead skin all over that you have to resist peeling. I get my lips touched up every year :)"
1593743919.0,2,"These specific ones I'm not sure, mine are prescription. I'm 100% sure you can get similar circle lenses without prescription, though!"
1593695460.0,5,"If you read her comment, she said she got semi-permanent makeup done. Those are tattoos"

1593705014.0,49,"I feel you. It's the same reason why I got all the tattooing done, it really became a chore doing the same makeup everyday. I found my aesthetician through a lot of research on IG. A year prior to booking the appointment, I had been keeping tabs on aesthetician portfolios. I only ended up considering aesthetician whose portfolios got considerably bigger over the year and who had a ton of good reviews. Try using hashtags to your advantage to see local artists, for example, #torontomicroblading or #newyorkmicroblading, etc. A good artist who is serious about her craft will post a lot of high quality before and after pics & videos."
1593705694.0,16,"Thank you! There's a lot of independent semi-permanent artists who rent out space to do their tattoo work, much like regular tattoos artists do. Your best bet is to look on IG, as most serious artists are using that plarform as a portfolio for their work. Try using hashtags to your advantage to see local artist in your city, for example #torontomicroblading. The procedure for eyeliner is very similar to tattooing; they prep and numb your skin, then use an electric tattooing pen/machine. It hurt a *lot* and was $400 2 years ago. The convenience, for me, is 100% worth the pain and the price tag."
1593745053.0,3,"Hurt like crazy despite numbing gel! I actually broke out in a cold sweat from the pain haha. It's a bit unsettling to have someone poking at your lash line so close to your eyeball. It took a bit over 2.5 hours. There was no bleeding at all, thank goodness. Despite the pain and big price tag ($400 not including tip), I would 100% do it all over again and I won't go back to using eyeliner again. That's how much I love the results."

If I use an oil-based cleanser, do I use it before my normal facial cleanser?"
1593700296.0,15,I'm no expert but I don't think you should use it that often. A water cleanser is enough in the morning to cleanse after sleep (or just water tbh) and then oil cleanser +water based cleanser in the evening to remove makeup and/or sunscreen.
1593719994.0,2,Ohh ok hehe i was gonna do that too and hoping that the peptide will still be effective even if i miss it the 1-2 times a week i do AHA (i can't use it in the morning as i use Vit C then daily).
1593787449.0,1,"I like them all. But if you need some exfoliating effect, radiance energy mask is better. It's thick, but not it never broke me out. Revitalizing Mask is also fine. Do you use it every day? I usually end my routine with Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Cream EX, and only use the RM about 1-2 times a week. I'm still on my 1st tube I bought last Sept.

BTW - if you want your pores to look small almost immediately, try Sulwhasoo Clarifying Mask (its' their peel off mask). Your pores look smaller instantly and the effect will last about 2 days minimum. It's the only peel-off mask that I think is worth the time & hassle."

I seriously Luv Asian skincare!   It has made such a difference in my skin.  Prior to this I use to skip the toner and apply facial oil which only led to dry skin.  My Chinese friend taught me a lot about water and hydration for skin prior to moisturizer and from there I started researching which led to my current Asian skincare fascination.  I have found amazing Asian skincare products which don't exist in the Western world.  The ingredient decks amaze me as they don't seem to include as many filler and cheap ingredients to stack up.  

The 7 layer hydrating toner method has improved my skin's hydration drastically and I'm only thankful.  

I enjoy conversing with other individuals who take their skincare just as serious!"
1593720502.0,5,"Oh god, I struggled so badly with acne until my mid 20s. I had so many scars, which contributed to me thinking I needed to cover my skin with foundation.

Having a skincare buddy is so awesome."
1593676235.0,54,"I'll break it down for you by procedure :)

Eyeliner: Hurt like crazy despite my artist being super careful and using a lot of numbing cream! I actually broke out in a cold sweat from the pain. Wouldn't recommend for someone who has very little pain tolerance. My eyes were crazy swollen the next day but by the 3rd day the swelling had gone down significantly. Then came scabbing and peeling and itching for a week or so. Not bad! 

Microblading: I fell asleep during this procedure. The only odd sensation was the feeling of the blade scratching into skin to make the individual hair strokes when the numbing cream was wearing off. Eyebrows go through a crazy dark phase, then it peels and itches, then the pigments fade. It takes about a month for the true color to show. Definitely a complicated healing process.

Lip blush: I fell asleep during this procedure as well. With lots of numbing cream it just felt like a gentle vibration on the lips as the artist worked. The healing process was similar to microblading, just more uncomfortable because our lips have more nerve endings. The peeling lip skin drove me nuts lol"
1593676466.0,19,It's especially great for those of us with oily lids and watery eyes. I kid you not I could not find an eyeliner that would stay on for more than a few hours. I was just so dang fed up with having to fix it when I'm out.

Also, be careful of what serums you use on days when you use glycolic acid; the active ingredients in glycolic acid mess with serums and boosters that have a lot of peptides, rendering the serums ineffective.

1593703141.0,8,"Some oil cleansers would trigger fungal acne. I‚Äôm not too familiar with the oils that do not trigger fungal acne. But I would assume that jojoba oil based oil cleansers or mineral oil based oil cleansers would not trigger fungal acne. The former being technically a wax that is closely similar to our own oil and the latter being a synthetic product.

Oil cleansers unlike the oil cleansing method contain an emulsifier that help wash away the cleanser. The emulsifier is trigger by water which is why oil cleansers are applied on dry skin. There is no residue left after the cleanser is rinsed off.

The benefit of oil cleansers is that most products that need to washed off the face are water resistant but not oil resistant. Oil cleansers help break up the bonds and lift the product from the skin. Then the water activates the emulsifier in the oil cleanser and it gets rinsed away. Thus leaving you with clean skin. Like all products, not all oil cleansers are made equal. Some are more suitable for certain skin types than others."

The bad- It feels fairly thick on the face. 
It leaves a greyish tone to my skin, doesn‚Äôt seems to fits well even after sometimes. 
It contains fragrance (but I don‚Äôt mind much)
Lastly, it breaks me out! After the first wear of a day I got 2 pimples popping out, I‚Äôve tried it again on the other day and it happened again.

1593755697.0,4,"Hello everyone! long time lurker, but finally decided to focus a bit more on skincare. So I need some help on product recommendation/routine building.


I'm male in early 30's. Skin type is combination (leans more towards oily; Fitzpatrick IV). I live where it's somewhat humid in the summer, but drier in winter. I have some slight acne issue and blackheads here and there.

I currently only have one routine as I don't use make ups. Here's the products I use:

* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* SKIN 1004 - Madagascar Centella Asiatica 100 Ampoule (this is a recent addition)
* CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion
* Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra-Light Sunscreen Fluid SPF 50 (I only use it if I go outside which is minimal these days)


On Product Recommendation
I'm trying to find new products I can try that can deal with acne/blackheads and slow/prevent aging. I saw some products being mentioned here, but without knowing each poster's skin type and condition, I'm a little concerned to try new things (I have no preference on AB/non-AB, but I do wanna try more AB products).


On Routine Building
I try to keep my routine to a minimum, but I don't mind adding a few more steps if it's beneficial. I saw in the wiki it's recommended to have two cleansers. I'm not sure how applicable this is to me. However, whenever I use sunscreen, I feel my current cleanser doesn't clean completely.

For rough skin, maybe something for exfoliation? You could totally make a homemade sugar scrub for this! Find a little jar of some kind and mix in equal parts sugar and coconut oil (you don't need much of either one), and you can add something like vanilla extract to it for a nice scent. But something like this can be harsh on skin and should only be a weekly thing. For a gentler exfoliation, Banila Co. Clean It Zero Balm is really nice. e.l.f. Cosmetics also makes an exfoliating scrub that's really nice and not too pricey (like $5).

If the rough skin is due to dryness, something moisturizing would be great! There are soooooo many moisturizers out there! I personally really love Hada Labo Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream, Tonymoly Chok Chok The Green Tea Watery Cream, and Scinic Honey All-in-One Ampoule if you want K-Beauty.

1593817663.0,1,"Why not both? :)

I can't speak for anyone else, but when I think of an ""everyday"" palette, I think of neutral and nude colors - so like beige, tan, brown, copper, and so on. But there's also nothing that says you can't wear neon purple or mint green every day either.

Personally, I lean much more toward subtle shades because bright colors look terrible on me and I find many palettes offer a large enough variety of shades that they can serve as an everyday palette or for more special occasions. I know I haven't seen a ton of more wild colors from K-beauty brands - I see a lot of nude, coral, maple and occasionally smoky colors.

To give you an idea of what I consider ""everyday,' the palettes I currently have and use on a regular basis are:

* Smashbox Cover Shot palette in ""Matte""

* L.A. Girl palette in ""The Nudist""

* Romand Better Than Eyes palette in ""Dry Buckwheat""

* Custom peach palette from Colourpop

* Huda Beauty palette in ""Nude"" (this was a gift, but it has a lot of pinks and glitter in it)

It just depends on what I feel like wearing, but I think any of them could be used for any occasion!"

Looking at the ingredients list, retinol is the fourth ingredient out of eleven and I don't know if Korean ingredients lists work like ours do, but if they do, it would imply that retinol is the fourth most prominent ingredient in this. 

That doesn't necessarily mean that it has tons of retinol, but out of the active ingredients, there is more retinol than anything else. That's a good thing. It also has 4.3 out of 5 stars on Amazon out of almost 3,000 reviews and anywhere else I've read shows similarly positive reviews.

I can't say for sure if it actually has that much retinol, but a lot of people sure seem to like it! It seems like it might be worth a shot - I might buy it myself if I wasn't already using tretinoin. If you don't like it, you could always sell/swap it on /r/asianbeautyexchange!

1593819651.0,1,"Never tried it, but Yeouth is a legit US brand, so they can't get away with lying about their ingredients. It doesn't specify the type of retinol used though, so it's difficult to say how ""strong"" it is.

1593790930.0,1,"I struggle with the like perma-bumps around my eye area too!  But I second the potentially harsh. A couple weeks ago I started doing retinol (Sunday Riley‚Äôs Luna oil) 2x a week in addition to 1x a week TO‚Äôs AHA/BHA and my skin started feeling cranky a few days ago (a little tight, sting-y) so now I‚Äôm putting that on pause to focus on soothing/hydrating. I think once my skin feels normal again I‚Äôll try 1x retinol and 1x exfoliate, or like 2x retinol and every other week swap one of them out for the AHA/BHA. Good luck!!"
1593819188.0,1,"The tiny bumps that never go away sounds like milia, which is a trapped build-up of keratin. They can be caused by using products that are too emollient around the eyes. You might need a dermatologist or esthetician to safely extract them. I don't think that milia respond well to most topical treatments. 

As for incorporating retinol, you can just alternate nights with your AHAs. It's fairly easy because you need to build up using retinol slowly anyway. Maybe leave off AHAs the first week, and try not to use actives for a day or two after you've applied your retinol until your skin is accustomed to it."

1593813234.0,3,"First start by using a gentle cleanser I personally am using zero purifying balm as my oil cleanser (when I use spf/makeup) and the innisfree blueberry rebalancing cleanser as. But the corsx good morning cleanser alot of people love (though it might be drying), and also the soon jung whip cleanser is a favorite among many. 


I'd advise you to not go for a physical exfoliator/wait on exfoliating because this can cause more redness depending on if you choose the wrong one. Toners you can also wait on until you decide how long you want your routine to be  top two toners are pyungkang yuls essence toner, and dear klairs unscented toner.  

For serums/essence its super important to find out what might irritate your skin (alot of people are sensitive to tea tree for instance) afew ingredients to look for are: centella, snail mucin, niacinamide.  Afew serums/essences that are very popular are:
-Benton ultimate snail serum
-cosrx 96 snail mucin essence
-purito unscented centella serum
-missha time revolution essence rx. 
There are so many great ones but it's super important to see what ingredients suit your skin. 


Next I'm going to moisturizers known to help calm your skin/reduce redness these are just afew.
My top choices are:
-Jumiso have a good cream with centella and snail
-Dear Klairs midnight blue calming cream
-Purito centella green recovery cream
-soon jung 2x barrier cream
-iunik centella gel cream
-Benton goodbye redness centella gel

Spf:
-purito unscented centella sunscreen
-cosrx aloe soothing sun cream
-dear klairs soft airy uv essence spf
-presonally I've used misshas sunblock daily and it worked well for me (but this one is definitely not as popular) 

Miscellaneous:
-Benton goodbye redness centella mask I swear this mask instantly calms my skin.
-Benton snail bee masks

It's always best to do your own research and compare what ingredients your current skincare products already have in them. For instance if your current products contain snail, or tea tree or honey and you do not break out/ are not sensitive to these ingredients your skin can most likely handle them. But as always make sure to test new products (dont just rub all over) to insure your skin can get acclimated to whatever product/ingredients you introduce it to. I hope this points you in the right direction to some products/ingredients to look for. Wishing you the best on finding the products that best suit your skin!"

The Centella Buffet has 3% Niacinamide, which is less likely to help with oil production, but it has Centella. That can help with redness. Niacinamide is a natural anti-inflammatory too. It sounds like the buffet probably fits your criteria more despite the lower Niacinamide %."
1593825303.0,2,Clio ones hand down.. i like the new beach muse as well from 3ce.. but clio color oay off is better
1593865592.0,1,"Not AB, but I really like the Viseart Paris Edit palette - it's tiny, travel friendly, and the shadows are great quality and overall super wearable."
1593825252.0,2,"Hey, your skin has flared up.. tret seems like the obvious culprit but its very difficult to pinpoint if that is it without knowing about anything else.. essential oil, fragrance are the biggest reason for redness, drop your regimen we can try weed it out"
1593826495.0,2,You might have better luck if you post to r/DIYBeauty.
1593865026.0,1,Why dont you try clindamycin as a spot treatment.. pimples can happen due to anything.. any skincare products takes atleast 2 to 3 montha to actually start showing results.. so it could be that some product isn't suiting you but then it could just be a normal flare up.. if these continue then you shouls try look ar your products again
1593865506.0,1,"Hey.. i would actually use the niacinamide with tret, they work great together, i have been using it for 2 years now, i dont like bp,  it makes you dry and flaky.. the acids sometimes cause you to purge.. is that what is happening? You can start with the klairs vit c that is super mild in the morning with sunscreen ofcourse.. if youre on tret i dont see why you need bp..

**edited to fix typos**"
1593869614.0,1,"Niacinamide works well with tret but so does Azaleic Acid, which is an extremely mild exfoliant that‚Äôs gentle enough to prescribe to rosacea patients. It does a little of what a BHA and an AHA do by getting down into the pores and exfoliating surface skin. It‚Äôs definitely an option if Vit C and normal AHA/BHAs don‚Äôt work for you. Most find it gentle enough to use alongside tret. For example, I had a prescription subscription that included tret, AzA, and Niacinamide, and I really liked the combo and felt they balanced each other well."

1593831953.0,2,thanks! I'll give these a try. what about the second cleanser and moisturizer? any recommendation on those?
1593799563.0,1,Thank you! Yeah i usually have really oily skin. Hence the need for lightweight moisturizer. Plus i use toner + fte + serum so maybe that might be enough hydration? I‚Äôm definitely more inclined to give it a try now! Thanks :)

1593769820.0,2,I‚Äôve been using it for 6-8 months :(
1593807698.0,2,"Interesting! That's the cheap local one (2,95‚Ç¨). I wonder what all those extracts and whatnot in the second one are for... I can maybe see why you'd put stuff like that in a moisturizer but does it have any function in a cleanser when you just wash it off a few seconds afterwards anyways?"

1593827585.0,1,thank you so much! do you use an eye primer when using the clio shadows?
1593912602.0,2,thank you! i'll look into them :D
1593826816.0,1,"Yeah, I guess so. But iirc, even before tret, I already noticed that my face is a different color than my neck so probably it's also another ingredient I'm reacting to. It's also a lot redder irl compared to the photo I uploaded. (I added another photo in the original comment btw) I think the slight whitecast of the milk sunscreen kinda evens or cancels out the redness and made me look pink. Here are the current products I use: 

AM

* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash
* Cos de Baha Snail Mucin
* Cos de Baha Azelaic Acid
* iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream or Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream (depending on how dry I feel and how humid it is)
* Kose Suncut UV Perfect Milk Super Waterproof

PM

* Biore Cleansing Oil 
* Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash
* Cos de Baha Snail Mucin
* Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream / Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream
* Gel tretinoin 0.025% (every other night)
* \*sometimes I apply another layer of moisturizer\*
* Petroleum jelly as occlusive (thin layer on places I flake)

Right now,  I think the Biore Cleansing Oil is  a possible culprit too per checking it's ingredients. And i've been using that for few years now. What do you think? I can replace that by Kose Speedy Cleansing tonight since my order already arrived."
1593866468.0,1,I actually tried acids and vit before and after starting bp and tret (I‚Äôd been using both for almost a month when I re introduced actives: Cosrx BHA and yes Klairs Vita C) but they wrecked my skin including. I take bp and tret because they‚Äôre my golden duo for non hormonal acne lol and even though tret has done a great job at smoothing and lightening newer scars and hyperpigmentation but concern is evening out my skintone from years of not wearing sunscreen as a teen.
1593853758.0,1,"My second cleanser is Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid face foam (after oil) or Garnier Micellar Gel Wash for Sensitive Skin(morning).

My favourite moisturisers (combination-oily skin) are  Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow moisturiser or Bonajour Green Tea water bomb cream.

My favourite toners are Klairs Supple Preparation unscented toner and I'm from Rice toner.

In summer I like a Niacinamide serum (I use 2Sol) to control oil. 

Everything I use is free from perfume, essential oils and drying ingredients."
1593804067.0,1,"In that case, the emulsion might actually be enough for you! It has squalane and some fatty alcohols in it, so even though it's lighter than other moisturizers, it's still heavier than a gel ^^"
1593777338.0,2,"Give it longer than 3 weeks for sure. It takes about a month for skin to turn over, so minium that with daily use."
1593816774.0,1,"I see. In that case, it should be worthwhile to add a Vitamin C product. 

Melano CC is a very popular Japanese product line, especially their Anti-Spot Essence. They have toners, spot treatments, and creams to help fade blemishes. 

There's also the Dear Klairs Vitamin Drop serum. It and the Melano CC serum have a similar lightweight oil texture, although I believe that they are both water-based.

I am currently using the Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot serum. I just got it yesterday, so I can't tell you how well it's working for me yet. But I purchased it on the recommendation of Liah Yoo, founder of Krave Beauty. It was on her ""Products I Wish I'd Formulated"" list, which has been nothing but hits for me so far. 

I hope you find something that works for you! :)"
1593813046.0,2,"I can only assume it is aimed for oily skin with the tea tree oil and betaine salicylate, but your guess is as good as mine as to what the rest does (or if it does anything).


I just look for a a simple cleanser, with low PH, that won't leave my skin stripped. 

I spend more money on the first step and get a good oil cleanser that I massage in for a minute. The second one is just a quick rinse."
1593817651.0,1,"Botanicals with dubious skin benefit claims are an easy way for companies to put fragrance in a product and to advertise it as ""natural"" and or ""clean."" Sometimes they're still good products despite this."
1593919445.0,1,"In that case, maybe you can get her stuff for a basic skincare routine. But please make sure she only tries *one* new item at each time, slowly adding on so she can see how her skin reacts!

1. Gentle basic cleanser - **Etude House SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** ask her to cleanse for 60s for PM, she could stick to washing with water in the AM at first

2. Gentle toners - Benton Aloe BHA Skin Toner (address her rough skin issue - use 2-3 times a week PM) or **Etude House SoonJung 5.5 Relief Toner** (on other days and all AM)

3. Serum - can alternate the ones you got for her - TO Alpha Arbutin+HA or TO Niacinamide with Zinc (only use 1 at first, maybe 2-3 times a week, and slowly build up) These serum step can address her hyperpigmentation issues!

4. Moisturizer - **Tony Moly Chok Chok Watery Cream** (AM) or Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask (PM)

5. Sunscreen (AM) - **Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun Screen**

The ones in bold are what I would suggest you to get for her if there are too many items! I made the recommendations because they are quite gentle and fewer chances of irritating her skin since she hasn't used much skincare before. Hope these help you in planning her birthday gift!"
1593919069.0,2,"I can help out a bit more, in that case! :)

[Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/isntree-green-tea-fresh-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1067993358) is an anti-oil facial toner, so it has a dual purpose. And if you don't mind some non-Korean items, I *love* [e.l.f. Cosmetics Mattifying Lotion](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/elf%2B-mattifying-lotion/91028.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyvmlh5O16gIVBaSzCh3qqQa3EAQYAyABEgLc5_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Matte Blotting Mist](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/elf%2B-matte-blotting-mist/91043.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyvmlh5O16gIVBaSzCh3qqQa3EAQYASABEgLJnPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - both are made with kaolin clay, which helps keep the skin from looking visibly oily for a few hours. They're the same price and either one would be great for oily skin.

Also, some hyaluronic acid is always good. Hyaluronic acid helps to retain moisture, so it's definitely a great thing to use with a moisturizer. [Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Gokujyun-Premium-Hyaluronic-5-7floz/dp/B06X3R1LL3/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=hada+labo+hyaluronic+acid&qid=1593917798&s=hpc&sr=1-5) is absolutely awesome and since you only need a few drops per application (I do one drop on my forehead and one on each cheek), this bottle will last a long time even with daily use.

Sunscreen is also always a good part of any skincare routine. I haven't used a whole lot of different sunscreens personally, but I love [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish](https://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Sunprise-Finish-SPF50/dp/B00WE3XGAC)! It's a little greasy, but not too bad. 

I have also heard that [A'PIEU PURE BLOCK Natural Daily Sun Cream](https://www.amazon.com/APIEU-BLOCK-Natural-Cream-SPF45/dp/B00J2Q5MSS) and [Missha All Around Safe Block Soft Finish Sun Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Missha-Around-Block-Finish-SPF50/dp/B00E9OXJUQ) are good choices for sunscreen for oily folks, and while I want to try them sometime, I can't say for sure how good they are.

A face cleanser might be good too. I love [Garnier SkinActive Micellar Water](https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Waterproof/dp/B019IK3A36/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&fpw=pantry&keywords=garnier+micellar+water&qid=1593918483&s=pantry&sr=1-7) and you can find it at any store that sells lotion (pharmacy, grocery store, Walmart, etc.) But note that if you get this, it really really should be applied with cotton pads, which you can usually find in the skincare aisle too. I've tried using this stuff with bare hands, cotton balls, paper towels and tissues and it really does go on best with cotton pads.

[Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/Biore-Deep-Charcoal-Cleanser-Ounce/dp/B00NQ2SEBG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&fpw=pantry&keywords=Biore+Deep+Pore+Charcoal+Cleanser&qid=1593918521&s=pantry&sr=8-1&srs=7301146011) is good for oil control and also acne. This has menthol in it, in case she has any sensitivity to mint or doesn't like the smell! One little note on oil control products, I think if you use too many of them at once, it can actually cause more oil because the skin tries to make up for the lack of oil, so maybe only pick one or two oil control items for your kit!

And any of those individually wrapped face masks you can find at just about any store would probably be nice too!

And if she needs to know what order to use stuff in, [this link](https://www.dermstore.com/blog/in-what-order-do-i-apply-my-skin-care-products-infographic/) will give a little more info. Also, let me know if you have a particular budget to stick to and I can make some different suggestions if anything I mentioned is too expensive."
1593791937.0,2,You're welcome! It just depends on your preference or how dry your undereyes. I usually wear it day and night but sometimes I forget during the day and it's fine. I use the Cosrx oil free moisturizer on my face and sometimes I just use that under my eyes.
1593818104.0,1,"I don't think I've been using tretinoin long enough to see a major difference just yet, but I do notice that I seem to break out less. And I don't see any *new* wrinkles, so I guess it's doing something! I also tried TO's retinol serums and they didn't do a thing for me.

Also, you can get tretinoin without a prescription! I order mine from AllDayChemist.com for like $4 a tube (compared to $300 my pharmacy wanted) and as long as you don't mind paying $15 for shipping and waiting like a month, it's so much cheaper to stock up this way. There's also r/tretinoin if you want to learn more about it.

But yes, tretinoin is considered a holy grail of skincare because it's the highest concentration of retinol you can get and it has been proven to minimize signs of aging. If you can get your hands on it, go for it! Just be careful because it can cause a little irritation and skin flaking, and be sure to wear sunscreen because retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun."
1593828151.0,1,"Well when i am doin just a simple matte like a wash then i dont, but say i want a better payoff of the glitters then i use my mac or too faced primer.. though i have used them without an eye primer also, like just use concealer as eye primer and that works equally good"
1593827992.0,2,"Okay so here i see the kose sunscreen has alcohol pretty high up , you should try replace that.. wash off treatments in my opinions should be the last that you should worry about, but if you have a hunch switch it out.. the cos de baha products have bunch of extracts in them.. that could also be triggering this redness.. id say strip it down to bare min keep the tret and ato ceramide remove the cos de baha products and change that sunscreen. Do this for a week or two, i think the witch hazel and eucalyptus in the cos de baha might be causing the reaction, plus the alcohol in the sunscreen, with tret, its getting a bit much for the skin to handle maybe.i do like the kose speedy one more, and ive been using that with dhc for 6 years now. I use tret as well and i use the normal soonjung barrier cream before i apply tret, they have more or less the same composition as far as ingredients go so i highly doubt its causing it so you can continue to use it. 
So 
1. Change the suncreen ( see the klairs midnight blue uv essense) has centella and guaziline so a good alternative to the iunik
2. Stop the cos de baha products 
3. Switch to kose
Do this for 2 weeks"
1593870630.0,2,"Bp will not even out your skin tone.. it works on active bacterial inflamations.. tret will over period of time smoothen your skin out.. but you need to give it time... bp should be your sos.. not a daily thing.. when i started using tret i decreased my exfoliation to once in two weeks cause you dont need it much.. but then i would do like the aha bha peel, stayed away from bha toners in general. 
Youve only been using tret for a month is what i gathered so obv if you add more onto it the skin might react.. but trust me you dont have to put on bp everyday it wont do anything for the eveness and will just dry you out
Dont use vit c and bp together either thats a big no
If youre purging then that will pass in 4 weeks or so.. its pretty normal for that to happen.. else you anyways got the niacinamide in, you can get arbutin for the day if you wanna avoid vit c, but please stop the bp all over your face, it will not show now.. but youre just ruining the moisture barrier with bp"

I'll go to a derm soon about an unrelated issue, I'll try to persuade them into giving me tret, thankfully the monthly cream dose will only cost around 2-5 USD, would be much better than what I'm paying for retinol, BHAs, peels, etc haha.

Wish you and your skin the best!"

1593874008.0,1,I think you missread. I‚Äôm been on using bp and tret for 2 years now. Bp is for my acne while tret is for scars. This daily combination is what my dermatologist and I has observed to be most effective and my moisture barrier is fine. A couple of months into starting this routine is when I tried in incorporate actives...so late 2018 and it went badly for me but because I stopped the actives early enough my skin was able to recover quickly. I was just looking for a less invasive hyperpigmentation treatment to accompany tret.
1593872932.0,2,I‚Äôve personally never had milia so I‚Äôm not sure
1593874137.0,1,Aah! Apologies.. did you try use bp and vit on alternate days? Irrespective niacinamide is amazing for clearing up skin and works well with tret so that wont bother your skin cause its not really an active..
1593885367.0,1,No problems :)! I did try alternating bp and vit c but I think my skin just doesn't like vitamin c if it doesn't come from food so I've been try incorporate more vitamin c rich food into my diet. Even vitamin c supplements have made my skin freak out. Do you have any niacinamide rich products to recommend?

This is the aftermath of a decluttering session. I love blush so much that I ended up keeping more than I expected. I'm into muted colors, but I like to try the odd color every now and then. 

Here are bite-sized reviews of my blushes:

The SAEM Semi Pro Multi Color
11 Beige
- staying power is the best amongst all my blushes (because it's cream)
- the color is quite pale for me so I usually just use this as a base for a more vibrant blush
- thick in texture, doesn't blend as easily as I'd like it to

too cool for school Check Jelly Blusher 
02 Apricot Sorbet
- has a mochi texture
- to be completely frank, I bought this when I had a coral phase and never touched it again
- a bright, vibrant true orange
- kept it because it's staying power is great and it's applies so smoothly 
- I love the formula, just wish I got it in another shade

3CE Mood Recipe Face Blush
Nude Peach
- I like this blush as a concept (lol) but once I wear it I end up layering too much because it's so sheer
- It's almost a fair skintone color, would recommend for those who aren't really into blushes but want color on their cheeks
- I‚Äôve panned mine already as it's so easy to go through 

Missha Cotton Blusher 
Mama's Camel Coat
- a My Cheeks But Better shade
- a light warm beige that leans tan, not an ounce of pink in it! which I find hard to find in Asian blushes
- has noticeable shimmers in the pan so it gives a healthy glow when you apply it

Etude House Lovely Cookie Blusher BE101 Ginger Honey Cookie
- probably one of my favorites
- a nude-y/browny pink with small flecks of shimmer in it
- (some describe it as an orange pink but I completely disagree)
- the shimmer is not at all noticeable when worn on the face imo
- the pigment is buildable so if you want a strong blush, this is quite apt for that

Missha Cotton Blusher 
Vintage Robe
- this used to have flecks of gold in it but I've used it so much that my pan looks matte now
- I would describe this shade as Romand's Dusty Pink in powder form

Etude House Lovely Cookie Blusher
BR401 Pink Brownie
- A mauve pink that leans cool-toned when I put it on my cheeks
- I don't use it as much bc the shade looks a little off on my warm skin but I see this working well with deeper skintones
- The formula is soooooo buttery and soft! I feel like this formula is underrated in the Asian Beauty community

Romand Better than Cheek
04 Fig Chip
- Love this because it blurs out my pores lol
- One of my faves in formula and color (planning on buying Pear Chip pretty soon) 
- I have to be careful with this because the color is outstandingly vibrant. 
- It's a warm pink with a lot of red in it

Peripera Pure Blushed Sunshine Cheek
01 Calm Pink
- my newest blush! another warm pink with a considerable amount of white base
- Quite powdery but I don‚Äôt mind
- I put this side by side with Benefit's Daffodil, and noticed this is just one step deeper to that blush
- The swatch here has about 3 layers, but the actual color when blended out is very soft and pastel

Canmake Glow Fleur Cheeks
10 Terra Cotta Fleur
- You can mix the colors to your liking, and I‚Äôm still trying to find the right amount of red, brown, and white that would suit me
- Quite glittery on me, I have to be careful bc the shimmers are quite noticeable
- I think it's an essential for my fellow Soft/Deep/True Autumns

Innisfree Jelly Cheek
03 Fig
- another one of those mochi blushers
- I'd describe this as a mauve red, if that color even exists. If you don‚Äôt use red blushes, but would like to try some out, this is a lovely color to start with.
- really pretty on the cheeks, completely matte, but somehow I always end up reapplying when I wear this
- I use this so much that its case is completely broken

Ever Bilena Blush On
Willow
- this is a brand from the Philippines
- my most brown blush (with a hint of red when applied on the cheeks), would look great with tan skintones to give off that almost sunkissed look
- There are flecks of shimmer in it, but disappear into a healthy sheen when worn on the face
- not as buttery as my other blushes, but the level of pigment makes up for it
- the packaging is quite flimsy

By the way, if anyone has more blush recommendations that fit into the color scheme I currently have, please tell me :)"
1593759627.0,3,Such a beautiful selection of shades! There are so many shades of the Etude blushers (esp the newly released ones!) I want but the bulky packaging looks like a hassle ;-; Do you find it bulky and/or flimsy?
1593760819.0,3,"This is such a fantastic breakdown! Thanks for your hard work! 

I love the Etude House Lovely Cookie Blushers as well -- so affordable and pigmented and smooth? It blows my mind."
1593836661.0,2,"Another dedicated AB blush lover <3 Thanks to you, I can save some money for wanting to buy too many AB blushes :P

Mochi blush: I noticed that your concept of mochi blush is really different than mine. When I look up online photos of the TCFS & Innisfree, they're cream blushes for me. My concept of mochi blushes would be A'pieu Juicy Pang Jelly and the Mac Glow Play.

Missha Vintage Robe: I have the Missha Vintage Robe as well, and I don't see any gold flakes in it. How long have you been using it?

Shimmer in blushes: How would you compare the shimmers in the Missha Camel vs the Etude House Ginger?  Which one is more skin-like to you?"
1593838883.0,2,"Hello! I know how you feel. I constantly want to check out more blushes.

Mochi blush: Mochi blushes are quite bouncy for me. If you press on them, your finger leaves a dry mark and if you apply them, the formula is almost cream-to-powder. A cream blush in my opinion would be something akin to Skinfood's Fresh Fruit Lip & Cheek Trio.

Vintage Robe: I‚Äôve had mine for over a year now. I‚Äôve used mine well and wonderfully so the top layer which seemed to have the small flecks of shimmer is gone. Though to be fair, I only noticed the glow in direct sunlight.

Shimmers: Definitely Etude House. With Mama's Camel Coat on the cheeks, you can definitely spot visible bits of shimmer."
1593766196.0,2,"I don't find the packaging quite bulky. In fact, I think the Canmake Glow Fleur Cheek's case to be more of a letdown due to it having a bigger area, though the dome-shaped top of EH may add like extra 3cm on top. I find that the Lovely Cookie Blushers actually have a little weight to them. Definitey not as fragile as I expected a roadshop product to be."
1593765761.0,2,"You're welcome, I was just bored one afternoon lol. 

Yes, Etude House really knows their way around powder products! They're a super approachable brand as well."
1593766273.0,1,Oh yeah the glow fleur is pretty big! I guess I just like it fine because it‚Äôs flat?? But I‚Äôm happy to hear the etude isn‚Äôt fragile! I should try it soon :) Thank you!

1593709015.0,22,Ceramide ato concentrate cream.
1593748505.0,8,"Forever this: Ceramide ato concentrate cream.

P.s: The gel from the same line is also great, super lightweight for humid weather. 

Everything from this line is so good that now I want to try the lotion so bad..."
1593752796.0,6,"1. Ceramide concentrate ato cream/gel : i like both gel and cream version. The cream version for winter and the gel version for summer
2. illiyoon probiotics skin barrier essence drop : affordable and effective. However it is not fragance free
3. Ceramide ato water toner: laneige skin refiner dupe"
1593766921.0,4,"I love the illiyoon lotion for my body all year around and for the face during the summer time. The cream is a bit too much for my skin, but I enjoy the lotion a lot as it's layerable."
1593767700.0,3,"Love, love, love the Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel. Have been lusting for it since its release, and I'm fast depleting my first tube. It's a lightweight gel, slightly creamy due to the squalane, and is quite moisturizing especially for humid climates, plus it keeps the tret flakes at bay well on its own!

I've got the Ato Lotion on my wishlist too."
1593721082.0,2,My holy grail moisturizer is their probiotics skin barrier cica balm! ü•∞I also bought the probiotics essence but I prefer the balm a lot more. It‚Äôs really good for dry skin in dry climates and I can use it all year round without any problems. It‚Äôs not fragrance free though if you are sensitive to fragrance but I don‚Äôt personally mind.
1593720161.0,3,I‚Äôve been looking for fragrance free body products so I actually use the ceramide ato top to toe wash and lotion on my body and the concentrate cream for my face.
1593747345.0,4,I like the Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream on my body but not my face.
1593738415.0,2,"The Oil Smoothing Balm is an amazing lip balm. It is super smooth, long lasting, hydrating, and overall fantastic. I'm one of those people who's always been obsessed with lip balms and tried ""everything."" This is the only one besides a super tacky sleep mask type balm that stays on."
1593806323.0,1,Ceramide concentrate cream- lightweight product
1593736229.0,1,Seconding this
1593793745.0,2,The lotion is great! Definitely recommend. I've just purchased my 3rd bottle. Its my go-to body moisturizer as I'm personally not too keen on the thick texture of the concentrate cream.
1593794405.0,1,what effects have you noticed from the probiotics essence drop?
1593864622.0,1,i wish the essence drop is fragrance free...would instabuy and hoard :(
1593769625.0,1,The repair or the oil smoothing one?
1593725465.0,4,How well does the top to toe foam? Also does it leave the skin dry or hydrated post wash?
1593748416.0,3,"Have you ever try the lotion on your face? I have the cream and it is a bit heavy for summer. I wonder how would the lotion feel like on the face? If it's as good as the cream but lighter, the lotion would be better in value :P"
1593864822.0,3,"this! i tried this, zeroid, and innisfree and this is probably the most i can FEEL it on my skin cream. zeroid is also thick but seems to absorb with a bit of time, ultimately went for the innisfree tho. i live in a humid climate and the illiyoon was just too suffocating.

their gel version of this is amazing tho, super moisturizing considering the consistency."
1593769435.0,2,No idea why you are down voted but may I ask why?
1593804813.0,1,how abt putting the lotion on your face as well? Would you share your thoughts abt it? I‚Äôm really want to try it that way
1593822212.0,1,"I started using this with tret 0.025%, I love its lightweight milky texture. A little goes a long way, three drops is enough. While the absorption rate takes some times because of its consistency but when my skin drinks it up, the effects are immediate. I did not notice any tret side effects like dry flakes, purging, irriations...."
1593770180.0,1,The ceramide ato lotion. I used the cream only in winter times but the lotion all year around for my combination skin.
1593731536.0,3,It‚Äôs hydrating. It also foams pretty well.
1593748708.0,3,I‚Äôll try it tonight.
1593865446.0,1,Are you talking about the Innisfree Green Tea Probiotics Cream? I want to try that one.
1593903683.0,1,"Agree with this. I've been using the Illiyoon cream for a few weeks and it never really seems to fully absorb and stays tacky. Weirdly, my face feels extra dry when I wake up because I think it all just rubs off on my pillow instead of sinking in? I have dry-leaning skin but this is my first summer in a super humid climate so I think I may need to try something else."
1593773587.0,2,"Because people can't handle it when someone says they didn't like their HG. Its pathetic.

It's heavy, tacky on the dry down and not that moisturizing."
1593805887.0,2,Its perfectly nice on the face as well; only thing is I don't know how it wears with makeup.
1593732537.0,2,Thanks üòä
1593865880.0,3,"yup! was on a strict fa safe routine but eventually went for it since most of the recommended ceramide products from cerave and other korean brands broke me out. didnt retrigger my fa thankfully. i emptied out my first jar last week after 2 months of daily morning and night use. I use a tiny bit in the morning since it does spread pretty well, and a thicker amount at night after tret. My skin hasnt turned into a leathery mess so I think the moisturizing power is good, feels very comfortable on the face too, no itching which i usually get from thicker creams and occlusives."
1593791559.0,2,"Agree with you on this. I'm using it right now on my body in the super dry climate I'm currently in, but the texture is not something I'd like on my face, even on my dry wintertime skin."
1593888476.0,2,"it wears beautifully in a satin-matteish finish when allowed to dry by itself, doesn‚Äôt pill under makeup! i use it as a facial moisturiser over less hydrating serums and as a hand cream :)"
1593807960.0,1,I forgot to do skincare last night but I did do it this morning and it absorbs quickly and is definitely much lighter than the cream.
1593792742.0,2,"The weird thing is, I normally love thick and emollient creams! The La Roche Posay Lipikar Balm is my HG, and that stuff is soo buttery. I also don't mind the thickness of the Zeroid Intensive Oint Cream, but there's something about the Illiyoon that makes it feel heavier and more suffocating than even the LRP and Zeroid (both of which contain massive amounts of plant butters: Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, respectively. Just trying to illustrate the thickness.)"
1593813264.0,1,I agree too! I bought the ato cream & lotion recently after a the raves but I find the lotion too light for my body compared to LRP & cerave and the cream is not as moisturising as Dr Jart ceramidin? I‚Äôll give it sometime but I‚Äôm not loving it as much as I thought I would.
1593675598.0,7,"From top to bottom! 
all have scents! 

Romand Juicy Lasting Tints in #11 Pink Pumpkin

Romand Juicy Lasting Tints in #07 Jujube

Romand Glasting Water Tints in #02 Red Drop

Romand Glasting Water Tints in #08 Rose Stream
- glasting tints are more sheer compared to the juicy lasting ones. The glossiness appears stronger after 20-30 seconds once applied. 

Peripera Ink Tint Serum in #02 Rosy Around
- strongest pigment and tint among the tints! weight feels like the juicy lasting ones."
1593697222.0,2,Oooh the peri pera ones do look very pigmented!! I want one now hehehe
1593699560.0,1,would you say rose steam is cool toned or warmed toned? the colour is so nice ><
1593702486.0,2,neutral? but leaning slightly to warm. yes it‚Äôs my favourite out of all the tints! the perfect mlbb rose shade
1593748959.0,9,"I‚Äôve been reading a lot recently that products containing AHA help with the pH, helping inhibit bacteria that causes body odor. So if you have an AHA serum, you could try that after a shower before using something scented like deodorant. I sometimes use CosRx Whitehead Power Liquid after showers, which was too harsh for my face, but works fine on my pits!"
1593745306.0,6,"My tips :
1. Wash twice a day
2. Use body lotion.
2. Use scentless deodorant, not AB, but exital works best for me. Not sure about J beauty, but deodorant is not common in K market. The most common on def is nivea
4. Use perfurm."
1593753940.0,3,"Are you looking for a perfume?   
If not/you're not interested in perfume, like someone else mentioned, you can just do scent layering. Basically what this means is, you use personal hygiene products that all have the same scent.   
Larger brands (a la Dove), have the same series of scents across all their products. You can find their cucumber melon scent (cool moisture) in shampoo, conditioner, body wash, deodorant and lotion. So, even if you're not using perfume, you'll have a relatively stronger scent (mainly because the product scents are the same)."
1593756903.0,2,Tonymoly has a cute little bunny perfume bar. The scent isn‚Äôt very strong but it‚Äôs easy to apply on your wrist and neck for a subtle nice scent.
1593858418.0,2,I use somebymi AHA BHA PHA 30 days miracle on my armpits and it really helps with the body odour. I read it on a thread once that AHA can help with body odour and sweating
1593748859.0,1,"use perfume body wash and apply perfume lotion after bath,both  scent are to be from the same series."
1593864556.0,1,"okay this gonna be weird but people have recommended using toners with bha since it's supposed to eliminate bacteria that causes acne...and it also happens that bacteria is the cause of odor. so any toner with bha should help( isntree, somebymi, cosrx bha etc.)


my personal favorite for it is stridex. way cheaper plus its nice to rub the cotton on my armpits and back area where i sweat a lot which causes body smell. first time i tried it i didnt smell at all the following day. so now i use stridex nightly on problems areas...takes care of body odor, prevents ingrown pit hair and texture, and takes care of the occasional bacne, super great."
1593876759.0,1,"Deodorant is usually not as strong and very rarely anti perspiring because most of us don't sweat as much as the rest of the world and also lack such a strong odor. Yes if I didn't wash for 5 days, especially in these tropics, I wouldn't exactly be smelling like peaches and fresh laundry, but on average I don't need a strong deodorant or something. Try soft stone maybe because that seems to be recommended as a strong one but it isn't that cute if you where hoping for that. As for scents I love the Biore U in the blue and white bottle - low pH! and the pink Moist Diane shampoo and treatment series. I use Kirei Kirei's peach foaming hand soap and a scent less tsubaki oil on my hair. I like Johnson's peach or cotton lotions and I don't wear perfume or body spray or deodorant or clothing spray. You can also look into laundry stuff like spray, detergent, softener, and scent enhancers but I use plain unscented."
1593880761.0,1,Have you tried persimmon soap? I‚Äôve heard of Japanese persimmon soap used for deodorizing purposes for the ‚Äúold people smell‚Äù associated with aging.
1593783972.0,4,"This 100% works and keeps me from getting ingrowns. I've used AHA (right after shaving oof), BHA (stridex pads), and currently PHA. I wash my face and pits at the same time (oil cleansing takes off deodorant residue!) so it's easy to do both with the same acid as next step."
1593770283.0,3,"I'm using Wakilala Clear Skin Essence. It's a Japanese AHA/BHA combo product for lightening the underarm area, and bonus, it's basically made deodorant redundant. I completely forgot to apply any deodorant today, and I smell like nothing at all. Bonus icing, I only have to use it 2 or 3 times a week."
1593752406.0,1,"I used this for a while after seeing Michelle's instagram. But it only worked for a short time, the smell was more annoying after I used AHA on my pits."
1593887209.0,1,What's an example fo a product that contains AHA? I'm a newb.
1593888478.0,1,Omg I need to try it. Thanks
1593785823.0,1,"Oh yes!! I somewhat recently started oil cleansing my pits on a whim (one with apricot oil that smells so nice), and I think that‚Äôs helping too! I don‚Äôt always remember to do it, but it‚Äôs a good way to use up oil cleansers that‚Äôs didn‚Äôt work out for the face."
1593788219.0,1,"Maybe some other ingredient in what you used could be feeding the odor-causing bacteria? Because the odors are off-gassing from bacteria eating sweat, basically, so if they are producing a different smell when you use the AHA, I would think they found something in that to eat."
1593821585.0,1,"No. I don't eat thing like spices, curry. For onion and garlic, i do eat them but not often. AHA only worked for a short time"
1593821913.0,1,"I meant the ingredients in the product you used. Because bacteria could eat that too, not just sweat.

If using AHA is creating a different but odd scent, then is possible that other scent is still bacteria-related."
1593608815.0,52,"Hi friends! This is my current routine, which I have been loving so far.

**Skin type**: normal leaning towards dry (being on Accutane) Used to be so SUPER oily I could fry an egg on my face. Rosacea-prone.

***Routine***

**AM**

* Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam
* Manyo Factory Bifida Complex Ampoule
* Derm‚Äôs moisturiser
* Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel SPF50
* Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50 for body

**PM**

* Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm

* Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask

***Short reviews***

**Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm**: The only oil cleanser I have ever used and I am on my Nth bottle of this, I think I‚Äôve been using this since 6 years ago. No frills, does the job, convenient and easy. (HG)

**Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam**: It‚Äôs a foaming cleanser but it does not dry at all, and leaves my skin really soft and plump, despite me being on Accutane (so that‚Äôs a good indication to whether this is stripping or not!) The feeling it gives is unmatchable to any other cleansers I have used. However I also want to try their Gentle Cleansing Foam, which is at a slightly lower price point. I‚Äôd still say this is an HG product for me. (HG)

**Manyo Factory Bifida Complex Ampoule**: I was using Estee Lauder‚Äôs ANR before this. This is a lot more watery and absorbs better, I would say. While I noticed a morning glow from using ANR, I wouldn‚Äôt say this Manyo product makes my face particularly glowy, but it does give a soothing effect and has a nice application feeling, and it has a great ingredient list. Maybe it takes longer for those anti-aging benefits to prove their worth. Being prone to rosacea, I love that it is a clean list compared to ANR. (WRP!)

**SK-II R.N.A. Eye Cream**: I bought this because, 4 months into Accutane + heavy air-conditioning in the summer, I find that my fine lines around the eyes are becoming more prominent, and I don‚Äôt want them to develop into wrinkles. Just the essence and derm moisturiser were not cutting it. It is also not too heavy in the way that it would stick around all night, or give me milia. I think it does the job, my fine lines around the eyes are definitely more subtle/ disappeared now. (WRP)

**Canmake Mermaid UV Skin Gel SPF50 Original Version**: I quite like it! Great application, serves well as a primer, alcohol-free. Although I‚Äôm rosacea-prone, I always find that my face is less red after I apply this? (This is not the tone-up brightening version). I like it more than the Purito Unscented Safe Sun, which was a bit too sticky for my liking and I felt that I had more freckles when on Purito. I still want to try a 100% mineral sunscreen though. (WRP)

**Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50**: I like it less than the Canmake, thus it is retired to become my body sunscreen. (I have 5 bottles of it left because my family bought so many of it when they went to Japan) I think it‚Äôs a bit grainy in texture too. I‚Äôm also avoiding it for my face after starting Accutance because of the alcohol in it. (WNRP)

**TO Argan Oil**: Just started this for 2 weeks. So far I like it for both my face and hair. Absorbs well I think I feel more moisturised with this added to my derm‚Äôs moisturised, particularly when I sleep in an air-conditioned room. Will see! (WRP, maybe)

**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask**: Absolutely LOVE. It just protects and (super mildly) exfoliates my lips so well. My lips gets easily dry on Accutane it does its job elegantly and beautifully. My current lips look even better (pinker and smoother) than how it was before Accutane! I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs overpriced, having used Aquaphor, Vaseline and Lucas Papaw to compare. I‚Äôm sticking to this. Religiously been using it every night for 6 months, I still have half a tube to go. I think I will just finish it at the 12m-after-opening mark. (HGGGGGG)"
1593627020.0,16,"Hey op, just a headsup that the banila co nourishing(yellow) is aimed for dry skin and the banila co purifying is for sensitive skin(purple)  in case you didn't know! Not saying the original you are using is wrong, just wanted to inform you if you ever want to try it out!"
1593629448.0,7,Clean it Zero is one of my favorites!!
1593621834.0,3,"I think we have similar skin types! Mine used to be very oily even in the winter and then two years ago turned very dry. Now it's just sensitive heh. I'll have to try that face wash, I like foam ones but hate the squeaky feeling some give."
1593646185.0,4,"I like the Canmake SPF so far too. It pills a bit on bare skin, otherwise I enjoy using it. It doesn't make my eyes itch"
1593630377.0,3,"I love the Laniege lip mask too!! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve tried anything else that‚Äôs hydrating and soft like this. I‚Äôve wanted to try the other scents but I‚Äôm really enjoying the berry one so far.

Does the lip mask come with a spatula?"
1593633867.0,3,"Definitely try out the sulwhasoo Cleansing Foam. It's by FAR my favorite cleanser, ever."
1593633477.0,2,Have you ever tried the Heimish All Clean Balm? I used to love the Banila co. one but find the Heimish doesn't leave the same film on my face.
1593636035.0,2,Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam! It's my HG too. Where do you buy yours? I used to buy it from Jolse but now it's gone. :( Sulwhasoo USA also doesn't have it. I heard it's been discontinued.
1593646450.0,2,I also use Banila co which takes my makeups off nicely and my acne-prone skin just feels comfortable after using it
1593651445.0,2,"clean it zero is my ultimate fav!! I have eczema and everything I used before gave me itchy skin and some even made my face swollen! But the clean it zero is the best, never had any negative results with it, tried it the first time years ago and never tried anything else ever again!"
1593655637.0,2,I have almost all of these! The lip mask is amazing.
1593642040.0,1,i don‚Äôt know why but whenever i use the Banila face cleanser i get some of it into my eyes (bcs i have to rub off my mascara too) and it leaves residue in my eye for a while until i rub my eyes and wash it out with a lot of water! has this ever happened to u
1593644228.0,1,If only i had the money to buy product but im currently jobless
1593685298.0,1,May i know how your skin changed from oily to dry? Ive really oily face but I don't see a difference even after diligently applying products like niacinamide. Thanks
1593688532.0,1,"omg finally someone who's tried the manyo factory bifida complex ampoule! i've been eyeing that for a while but apparently there's another one from the same line, the bifida *biome* complex?? it seems to have more ingredients."
1593628297.0,-3,great product ... dude
1593618777.0,14,I currently have your old skin that's super oily (also very acne-prone). Did you have any HG?
1593629457.0,4,"I use sulwhasoo gentle cleansing foam - it is my HG! I simply can‚Äôt use any other face wash/etc compared to it. I have sensitive and dry skin, and this makes my skin feel fantastic afterwards, not stripped or anything...try it out!"
1593628753.0,5,How does the argan oil smell? I have some from a different brand and it absolutely reeks.
1593634922.0,2,I love the Banila and Co oil cleanser! I find that it really cleans out any left over grime or sunscreen and does its job well
1593643297.0,3,"Not OP, but I was just wondering, have you tried the different ones and noticed a difference? I got the ‚ÄúRevitalising‚Äù version because it was the only one in stock at the time and I think it‚Äôs great, but my skin is dry so possibly ‚ÄúNourishing‚Äù would have been an even better fit. But I get the impression that there isn‚Äôt much performance difference between them... or is there?"
1593650579.0,2,"Oohh, good to know. I knew there were other colors but never looked into it. I‚Äôll check that out. Thanks :)"
1593622373.0,4,"Yes! My skin is sensitive too. But it‚Äôs also a picky kind of sensitive lol it does okay with some fragrances and alcohol but certain parabens give me a bit of an itch.

When I got the cleanser the lady said to squeeze and use around the length of 1/3 pinky finger, but I find even half of that works well for me."
1593670227.0,3,I bought mine in Hong Kong last summer and it did come with rubber spatula and protective pocket to keep it in :)
1593649349.0,2,"Mine actually didn‚Äôt (or maybe I missed it out while unpacking? idkk) but I bought it from a Laneige shop and is the new version. My mom got her old version elsewhere and had the spatula.

I don‚Äôt mind it too much though, I always make sure my pinky is clean before I dip in a bit!"
1593649385.0,1,Can‚Äôt wait!!
1593650039.0,1,"I actually did find the old version leaving a bit of a film on my face, and I had to use stronger second cleansers back then (a few years ago). But hlfway through the years the changed the formulation and with the new one, it hasn‚Äôt happened to me!

I haven‚Äôt tried the Heimish. Into my to-try list ;)"
1593649621.0,2,"I‚Äôm in Asia so there are several Sulwhasoo shops/counters around, and beauty supermarkets stock them too. I just went by a counter last week to look at some of the other products and Snowise was still there. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be of any much further help..

Others are saying the Gentle Cleansing Foam is amazing too and I really want to try it next!!"
1593652100.0,1,"Haha same. I‚Äôm usually the type that wants to try different types of ingredients and formulations and such but this the the product that I never bothered/thought of changing. 

My friend gifted me a bioderma micellar water before, I tried it for 2 nights, and man I really didn‚Äôt like it. I think it just felt so weird, filmy, and maybe gave me some small spots too."
1593652239.0,1,"I love using it too! I have the purple tub though. Not sure if this is normal, but when you rub your eye makeup off with it (eyes closed), does it usually cloud your vision even when you try to rinse it off? Eventually my vision is clear again after several rinses but it‚Äôs a bit concerning to not be able to see for a bit lol."
1593659256.0,1,High 5! We have similar taste and considerations when it comes to deciding which products to go for! :))
1593649897.0,3,"Hmm...I always close my eyes when I use it around the eyes, and when I‚Äôm massaging the mascara off. It hasn‚Äôt happened to me this way."
1593661501.0,1,Yes I have the same problem with oil cleanser. I use the the I‚Äôm from fig cleansing balm. Even if my close my eyes.
1593686923.0,1,"Ahh, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on accutane. It‚Äôs a medication for acne and stops sebum production. I have 9 months left on my course"
1593691778.0,2,"Ooh I havent seen that! from where I get it, they don‚Äôt have it stocked haha. I think I will stick to this one for now to save the hassle."
1593621311.0,12,"I never really got to improve how oily my skin was, despite trying to hydrate it. I was also very acne-prone (genes, ugh!) so it felt like whatever product I used didn‚Äôt make a huge amazing difference. However below are some items that I always went back to for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù skin days.

Cleanser: Banila Co Clean It Zero has been and still is my HG, and when I had oily skin, I get grits ever night when I use it to remove my make up. Before Accutane, I went through many bottles of Innisfree Bija Cleansing Gel, it was pretty good and non-stripping! I remember choosing it for its ph level (although I forgot the number).

Essence: Purito‚Äôs buffet serum (both scented and unscented) worked well for me. There is 3% niacinamide which noticeably helped my pores look cleaner and tighter. I noticed that if I didn‚Äôt use it the gunk in my pores were a lot more obvious and fill up more quickly.

Toner: Kikumasamune high moist!! Ok this was definitely HG. I actually still use it from time to time but I forgot to include it in the shelfie. It was so hydrating, I think it did help the face get oily less soon. I used it on its own on hot summer nights when I don‚Äôt have aircon on. Slightly brightening too. I use it on my body too after shower.

Spot Treatment & Mask: Generally not a fan of Body Shop products, except for their Tea Tree Oil for acne spot treatment. And their Himalayan mask was a repurchase item for me, it was refreshing."
1593670104.0,2,"Not certain if you can get this in your pharmacy but Epiduo (at night) works by 'drying' your entire face + benzyl peroxide has a slight antibacterial use. However, because of how potent it is, you may need to ease your way in when using it.

You can also get Duac (Benzyl peroxide + clindamycin - antibiotic) for morning time.

Also, anything with niacinamide is also amazing (though the effects seem to decrease after a period of time)

When I use it, I directly put it on my non-wet face, massaging in circles everywhere except the eyes, and then I do the eyes last with my eyes closed. Mascaras need more time but doing it softly without tugging the lid or digging the lid open has helped! I usually then open my eyes briefly to find the tap and wash it off.

1593698083.0,19,"Double cleansing can be helpful and might not be necessary depending on many factors. The first cleanser is either micellar water, an oil cleanser, or balm cleanser. The second cleanser is water based and can be a gel, foaming or milk cleanser.

1. If you have strong makeup or sunscreen and your regular cleanser isn't cutting it, then yes, double cleansing will help remove them and keep your pores clear.
2. If you have oily skin, the first cleanser can help keep your pores clear of oil clogs.
3. Alternatively, a minority will use a first cleanser but not follow up with a second cleanser since the first cleanser removes everything cleanly (no residue). I think those who do this tends to have dry skin though."
1593697667.0,8,Not everyone double cleanses but I think it is worth trying if you wear makeup and/or sunscreen.  I double cleanse most days but if I haven't worn sunscreen I don't.  Some people use micellar water for their first cleanse instead of an oil cleanser.  The second cleanse is usually a foam/gel/milk water based wash.
1593698244.0,4,"If you use sunscreen (particularly water-proof ones) or makeup, double cleansing can be helpful on a daily basis to get a proper cleanse. On days you're not wearing makeup or heavy sunscreen, a water based cleanser alone can probably suffice. 

You are correct in that you use the oil-based cleanser first (applied onto a dry face, massaged around, add water, massage to emulsify, rinse off) and then follow up with your water based cleanser (on damp skin). 

My personal HGs (I have dry skin though) include DHC deep cleansing oil & muji sensitive skin cleansing oil. 

Some recs for oiler skin include hada labo gokujyun cleansing oil & kose softymo speedy cleansing oil"
1593710084.0,5,"Combination sensitive skin here and I love double cleansing. I don't wear make up and my sunscreen isn't waterproof, but I still feel one cleanser doesn't do the job properly. Even on  days when I stay in and don't wear sunscreen,  I sometimes double cleanse as it really unclogs my pores. 

I used to be more of a balm fan- Clean it zero (without artificial fragrance)/ Heimish/ Clinique, but now I am using an actual oil from Muji and I really like it. Want to try the Kose softymo that everyone raves about next."
1593705156.0,3,"I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin and can't double cleanse. I still oil cleanse if I'm wearing a lot of makeup but if I rub too much, I end up having red cheeks and start breaking out. So if it's just suncreen and no other makeup, I take my hydrating cleanser and just cleanse gently 2 or 3x."
1593706071.0,3,"I double cleanse everyday because I think my oil cleanser does a great job of removing whatever skincare products I have on, including sunscreen. I also massage the oil cleanser for a good 3 minutes and can see all the grime it gets off my face, including the occasional grits. It‚Äôs also wonderful for removing makeup and I prefer it to makeup removers. My second cleanser is also super gentle and helps rinse off any remaining film on my face or the conditioner that inevitably gets on my skin when I was my hair. 

I also oil cleanse in the morning, esp if I‚Äôm using heavy occlusives or tret. My skin can get dry, dehydrated easily and I never have issues with double cleansing drying me out. In fact, I think it helps to fully remove products and clean my skin well. I use Kose Softymo speedy cleansing oil and the Hada Labo gokyjun foaming cleanser."
1593709958.0,2,I double cleanse every day because I wear sunscreen every day. My skins texture and acne have improved since double cleansing and I feel like my essences/serums work better if I‚Äôm fully clean. I currently use clean it zero but DHC cleansing oil is a good one too.
1593725018.0,2,"I was skeptical of the double cleaning when I first started AB, but I do it almost ever day even if I don't wear any makeup (the days I don't I'm just lazy lol). It made a big difference in my skin. I would suggest you try it for couple of months with a fragrance free oil cleanser and see how your skin does. You can always stop if you don't like it or your skin doesn't react well. If you don't want to invest in an expensive product, you can start with plain oil like grape seed and go from there. You have to wipe it off with a gentle wash cloth or facial tissue because there is nothing to make an emulsion that will wash off. However, you can try oil cleansing with less money. If you like it, you can move on to other products."
1593712295.0,1,"If you wear makeup daily then a double cleanse makes sense, however if you only spf on a daily basis then you can get away with oil cleanse (or micellar water be sure to rinse) regularly.  Those of us who do not wear makeup can simply use a oil cleanse daily for clean results."
1593739638.0,1,"I wear sunscreen and/or light makeup and I‚Äôm simply too lazy to double cleanse. My water based cleanser works well enough that I don‚Äôt feel it necessary. And if I do feel it necessary, I just cleanse twice with my water based cleanser. I just truly dislike having a ton of product in my cabinet or standing in front of my sink for 20 minutes to ‚Äúdo it all.‚Äù I‚Äôve been so much happier since I just got honest with myself about how much I really want to do (or rather don‚Äôt want to do). So do what you‚Äôre happy with and leave the rest."
1593763193.0,1,Not everyone double cleanses especially bc some people actually find that their skin gets worse from all the cleansing. I‚Äôd say 1 cleanser is enough. 2 cleansers makes sense if u wear a lot of makeup though.

When I have irritation on my skin I use aloe vera or innisfree green tea serum to cool it down! Maybe that could work for you?"
1593708218.0,1,"Maybe you can try using micellar water as a first cleanse? Soak the cotton pad and leave it on your face for a few seconds, then gently wipe your face in a upwards motion. My friend with sensitive skin does that and the few seconds does wonders to the ease of removal."
1593728730.0,1,"I use the banila zero to remove make up and yes, all the way! I prefer it over make up wipes! I have oily skin and get really greasy midday which is why I'm considering double cleansing. I've also heard great things about those two brands. Do you think the kids or HL is better?"

I was hesitant to double cleanse because I was worried my skin will break out or be stripped. (I'm just starting to repair my moisture barrier). But if I can improve my skin another level, I'll do it! I was thinking of purchasing the hada labo cleansing oil cos I heard great things! 

Do you also double cleanse in the morning? Or cleanse at all with either the oil, water based, or just water?"

1593759083.0,2,"not the same commenter but I have oily skin and previously i was just washing with water in the morning. this was good while my moisture barrier was very damaged but since repairing that it doesn't feel like it quite lifts the heavy occlusive moisturiser i use before bed. 

i've since started using a quick swab of micellar water then rinsing and it feels much nicer. however if you oiliness is from dehydrated / damaged skin this may be too drying and i would just use water."
1593773540.0,2,"I don't double cleanse in the morning, I just splash with water!"
1593748389.0,1,"I generally don‚Äôt feel the need for a double cleanse in the morning as my night products do not build up like makeup/sunscreen.

1593734121.0,1,"Practical more than anything- need to replace recently and the only balm available was Clinique at an inflated cost (also don't like that it doesn't have place to keep a spatula).

1593652607.0,5,"thought id write about some of my first and oldest makeup since im stuck in quarantine


this tiny cube has been my everyday eye look for the past year. 1st color is an easy muted pink brown base, can be a stand alone color all over or a base. 2nd color is a shimmery pigmented light champage, shimmers is silver, i use it for the aegyosal or inner corner. 3rd color is a basic brown, i have monolid and dark crease color looks off on me so i just use this brown as an eyeliner or i use it on top of a gel liner to set it and make it last loooong. can also be used with no.2 shimmer to make a fake aegyosal lol. 4th color is a super pretty warm red with red and gold shimmers! i smudge it on my lower outer eye corner to make my tiny eyes look a bit longer and defined, looks super fresh.

5th color is the big red blush pan. its a neutral to cool red that scared me at first bc i thought it would be too bright but light layers of it looks like a nice pinch on the cheeks.

as for the quality, they are so so and beginner friendly since the colors all look good togther. typical korean not too pigmented colors to start with and good for those who are comfy with a few shades/doing the sameish look everyday. very travel friendly too, took it on a japan trip and it lasted decently and didnt wear off messy.

It definitely does have a gentle brightening effect, though not everyone‚Äôs PIH responds well to the same ingredients I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth a try. It‚Äôs also a nice hydrator which can be easily layered in any routine. I went through one bottle and stopped since I didn‚Äôt want my face to be a totally different color than the rest of me, haha.

Personally, I have never seen a real difference in PIH from any Vitamin C. The Timeless product is very nice and I hear great things, so I think it‚Äôs a great Vitamin C if your skin responds well to Vitamin C. I‚Äôm on my 2nd bottle and while I think it‚Äôs a nice antioxidant to have in your routine, I don‚Äôt expect it to do any miracles as far as fading dark spots.

At the end of the day, fading PIH is mostly a waiting game, where sun protection is probably the best thing you can use to make sure it doesn‚Äôt get darker than it already is. Adding in another active can help a bit, but figuring out which one is going to work is kind of a trial and error process. It could take many months so just remember to take pictures so you can track what‚Äôs working :)"

The moist one is more viscous and I have used a bottle of it (for my neck and arms). I'm currently using the Light one. I think I like the Light one better as it's less tacky on my skin. I do live in humid tropical southeast asia so most stuff are heavy if used here.

As for result, I'm not sure if I'm seeing stuff. I am not that tan to begin with. But it's a pleasant lotion for me. I also use it on my hair when I just freshly bleach them, to give moisture back.

Make sure to use good sunscreen to lighten those pesky PIH/PIE - it makes a whole of difference for me"

The AIO Cream absorbs so well, hydrates like crazy, plumps and softens.

I actually think the AIO Cream is more lightweight because it feels lighter on the skin due to the better absorption. The Essence just sits on the skin. I hate the Essence."

I have NC40 skin and they are both kind of MLBB shades with Litchi Coral being a little brighter. I have pretty pigmented lips and they still show up and have nice color payoff especially if you layer them.

Honestly I really love them because they are kind of unique in terms of texture/finish/lasting ability and the colors are beautiful. They‚Äôre not life-changing, but they just happen to be exactly what I like in a lip product so I plan on repurchasing...I‚Äôm particularly enjoying them just sitting at home with no other makeup on because they are hydrating and make me look like less of a bum LOL.

As for wrinkle prevention, sunscreen is your best friend. Other than retinoids, there is no ‚Äúmagical‚Äù ingredient/ product that will prevent/ target signs of aging, so don‚Äôt buy into the bs the cosmetic industry‚Äôs trying to sell you. üí™"
1593606852.0,134,Sunscreen.
1593613639.0,36,"To touch on the ""eye creams are a marketing ploy,"" some absolutely are. There are eye creams that are obviously overpriced without a difference in ingredients or product composition. If you have a moisturizer or serum that targets your eye issues, ex dehydration making bags more prominent or dark circles mildly reduced with a brightening formula, and does not irritate YOUR eye area, then you probably don't need an eye cream.

Eye creams are generally formulated to be less irritating to the eye area since the skin is thinner and more delicate. They are also often more occlusive than a typical moisturizer. It's a good idea to compare price vs ingredients vs reviews vs your actual needs from what your routine is lacking before just jumping into getting an eye cream or believing they're all marketing ploys. No eye cream will make bags go away if you've had them you're entire life from genetics but some can minimize the concerns.

I personally use CeraVe's Intensive Repair Eye Cream bc it's very low cost and making my eye area more hydrated and plump so my dark circles are definitely minimized. There are also some vitamin C eye creams and retinol eye creams that are absolutely worth looking into since vit c and retinol can be extremely irritating ingredients. Eye creams with these two specific ingredients are typically formulated differently than just a regular moisturizer to be more gentle. Without diving into a vit c or retinol eye cream, focusing on just keeping the area very hydrated while you're young combined with using sunscreen religiously should probably be enough for your needs."
1593608342.0,20,"A normal moisturizer that you use for your whole face, sunscreen during the day (please reapply every few hours in sunlight) and retinol before bed if the skin around your eyes can handle it (light can degrade it). I use my tretinoin on my eyelids and undereyes but it can be too harsh for some people, so if you want to try a retinol, try a small amount once a week. As someone else said, a separate eye cream js just marketing to make you buy something you dont need."
1593613686.0,7,"I agree with using retinol, or an eye cream formulated with retinol. Its the only ingredient scientifically proven to help with wrinkles through speeding up skin turnover. I used to just apply my retinol cream all over my face, and use the remainder on my fingers for the under eye area. 

You could also try using tretinoin, but it may be too harsh for the eye area if you hadn't already gotten used to using it for your entire face. Hence retinol may be a good stepping stone cause it's milder but you still get the skin turnover effect.

If you're still apprehensive about retinol for your under eye area, and just want a straight up eye cream recommendation, then I would strongly suggest:

Sulwhasoo Essential Rejuvenating Eye Cream EX. 

Like the other commenters, I used to think eye creams were just a waste and you could get away with using your facial moisturiser. And I also had my share of budget friendly but disappointing eye creams. 

But I saw the light when I tried a foil sample of this. Literally within the week of using that sample, I noticed the fine lines had plumped up and were less noticeable. Still there, but definitely looked more ""ironed out"". And you might think that a foil sample wouldn't last that long, but you only need the tiniest bit with this one. The texture is pretty runny, and it feels more like an emulsion (great because my eye area is milia prone too) but it hydrated sufficiently and more than that the effects on my fine lines were just truly too good to ignore. 

So try and see if you can get your hands on some samples first! I think that's the true beauty of AB, that you can try things out before committing to the full-sized of anything.

Also I gotta credit the AB subreddit with this find, cause someone else had posted about this some time ago. I got the sample based on their recommendation and let's just say I'm really glad I did.

Edit: For reference I'm in my early 30s with pretty much normal/ slightly combo skin. 
I started noticing fine lines under my eyes as soon as I hit 30, even with using sunscreen since early 20s, and retinol in late 20s. So you may do everything right, but wrinkles are a part of life. With that said, there are products that help with the appearance/ prevention so don't give up! üíõ"

1593611491.0,2,"I don't think there's any. Not yet, maybe. Agree with what  other said, Sunscreen is the best for antiaging, wrinkles and dark circles prevention. If your eyes have already had those things, suncreen helps avoid further damage or worse condition. I use Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk APF 50 around, under, and upper eyes (eyelid). This has no alcohol and fragrance, (but it contains hyaluronic acid and some people are sensitive to it), so I guess it's delicate enough to use on eyes area.

Anyway, I tried using tretinoin around my eyes too (mixed with eye cream) for a month, but then I stopped. Still too drying and it made fine lines around my eyes more visible. Maybe if I was consistent enough continuing using tret for my eyes, I would eventually see results. But I was too scared. Lol.

1593615886.0,1,"Ok I'll actually answer with an eye cream - I do agree with what everyone said here though, the best thing for wrinkle prevention IS tretinoin & sunscreen.

That aside, I find eye creams do make my wrinkles less apparent, helps makeup wear better, and avoids that late afternoon dry feeling I get on my under eye. Face cream alone will not prevent it (I had dry skin before tret, now it's just hopeless). And I guess my face being dry could lead to wrinkles, so I guess maybe eye cream helps a little.

Anyway! AB ones I have used at least one full size container of:

- benton eye fermentation cream - this is my current favorite. THICK formula, kind of a pain sometimes to smooth out, but I can put multiple layers on (so I can then put concealer on) & have no issues with milia. I like that it's in a squeeze tube.
- Belif eye bomb - feels very soothing & hydrating, works GREAT under makeup (I wore this on my wedding day when I'd obsessed about every detail) but can be stingy if my skin is feeling sensitive.
- Mizon snail repair eye cream. It was okay - I actually found that I prefer the mizon wrinkle night pack under my eyes during the day if I really need heavy moisture. Very thick & slimy.

Would love any suggestions if anyone else has some!! I still haven't found that perfect eye cream."

1593629450.0,1,"Only two products have made visble difference in my eye area.  
 
First was a non-AB product, the Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Serum. I got one travel-siced bottle of this in my early 20's as a gift and after a few times puttig it on my whole face used it only on my eye area because it made such a difference. Now AB has a pretty-much-a dupe, Missha Borabit Ampoule (Also known as Long Name Ampoule on this subreddit, pertaining to the old official name Time Revolution Advanced Night Repair Serum) but sadly I haven't experienced the same effect on my undereyes though I liked the Missha one for full face. I do suspect that it was simply because there was 15 years between using these two products... But since OP is so young I think it might be worth it to at least test it in a store to see if you like it (as EL is, it is DEF scented, but I really enjoyed it back then).

The second is an AB product that I bought in recent years and have rebought and still use: SU:M SEcret Repair Concentrated Eye Cream. Now SU:M is a luxury brand and I'm not made of money so I simply bulk buy samples from Ebay. I don't think it has Very Long-Lasting effect, but if I have a formal occasion or a job interview etc. tomorrow, you bet I'll use it and look very refreshed next morning.

1593724597.0,1,"The advice of using sunscreen around your eyes is good! I would add to the eye cream debate that it is going to depend on you and your skin. I have tried just using moisturizer and with my dry skin it isn't enough, mainly at night. I would suggest you try using your regular moisturizer for a couple of months and see how your skin looks and feels. If you want to try an eye cream, don't spend more than $30, or less depending on your budget. You can also try just introducing the eye cream at night only. You may not need to use it twice a day. I recommend the CeraVe hydrating eye cream or derma-e hydrating eye cream. Both are non-AB. For AB, I haven't personally tried e, but have heard great things about is the mizon snail eye cream. The main thing you want to look for is no fragrance or essential oils because it is going to be so close to your eyes and delicate skin around the eyes."
1593784694.0,1,Eye area being very sensitive needs extra care. So using a good under eye cream really helps to get away with wrinkles and fine lines.

1593607660.0,69,Omg i love your comment. I feel like its a wake up call because im falling for all these marketing strategies and im actually stressed out with which products to get. Thank you!!!!! definitely appreciate this!!
1593610611.0,14,Do you use sunscreen even if you're inside all day? I WFH full-time even without covid so I tend to slack with sunscreen
1593613832.0,8,"Im so glad people aren‚Äôt trying to peddle my expensive ass tiny jars of lotion lol! Here‚Äôs my question- I wear sunscreen on my face and it‚Äôs fine (neutrogena clear face 50 Spf) but when I actually apply it to the thin skin around and under my eyes and on my upper lids, it burns like crazy and then immediately starts dripping into my eyes and burning after being outside in the sun for like 5 minutes.. 

Help?"
1593611711.0,12,"All of this!  I got heavy into skincare in my 20s, and was so sure I needed an eye cream but I'm also cheap as hell and refused to pay so much for so little product, so I just started making sure to bring my regular moisturizer up to my under eyes and lids (don't forget the lids!).  I'm creeping up on my mid 30s now and not a crinkle in sight!"
1593615447.0,5,Totally agree. Sunscreen for prevention and retinol (the #1 anti aging ingredient). You have to be very careful with retinol around the eyes area. You don‚Äôt need to use it every night because if you use too much or too often it makes the skin dry and actually gives you wrinkles. I apply a thin layer of cerave moisturizer as a buffer then retinol then moisturizer again. Skin around the eyes are very thin and delicate so make you don‚Äôt rub it but pat the products in.
1593616023.0,2,"Do you need a specific sunscreen formulation for undereyes, as regular ones are too ‚Äúthick‚Äù? Or is that another marketing tactic? Thanks for this answer!"
1593672912.0,2,Thanks a ton!!! I just saved myself some dollars from my cart! Truly needed this comment. :) Would you recommend reapplying sunscreen even when we are at home?
1593625829.0,17,"Sunscreen but also SUNGLASSES so you're not squinting to see all the damn time when you're outside. 41 & not even a hint of crow's feet over here, thank you sunglasses."
1593619926.0,13,And water!!!
1593622548.0,2,Wish someone could tell all the ladies this
1593619972.0,12,yeah i have sensitive dry eyes but overall oily skin so eye cream is necessary for me also using face cream gave me milia. Took forever to get rid of that. I use no.7 youtful eye serum and it has gotten rid of some of my fine lines.
1593626379.0,5,A few months ago I bought a moisturizer thinking it was a very well priced eye cream lol. I was considering buying the eye cream version of the moisturizer but when I compared the ingredients I realized it‚Äôs literally the exact same product just repackaged! ü§° And after reading all these comments I‚Äôm just going to keep using the moisturizer and start wearing sunscreen even indoors haha
1593672661.0,2,"Yeah, I use an eye cream because I need a thicker moisturizer there than on the rest of my face, and I have a cheap eye cream that works for me. (Sana, it goes down to 500 yen on sale and lasts me a few months), so I've never bothered trying to find a gentle moisturizer in a bigger size that works for my eyes."
1593622536.0,4,"I'm going to second the Sulwhasoo suggestion. It 100% made a difference for me. Once I hit 28 (now early 30s) I started seeing a few eye lines, and the Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream EX was the product that made them go away. This one is more like a cream, not an emulsion. I buy multipacks of the foil samples and it is pretty cost effective as they last a long time."
1593613448.0,5,"Yeah, I use that one at night. I know other people have commented that eye creams are useless, but the skin under my eyes is thinner and drier than the rest of my face which is oily. So I like to use a richer moisturizer under my eyes. I also use Kumargic eye cream during the day."
1593615334.0,2,"I loved the consistency of the innisfree one, but it is so fragranced! I ended up returning it. Hoping to find a similar one with no fragrance..."

1593619005.0,1,Just a clarification at this point im really confused if retinoids are also similar to tretinoin? Im getting a lot of comments that tretinoin is the only proven etcetc and also retinoids are the only proven etcetc. Sorry if i cant explain it properly but i hope u get my question lol
1593605672.0,7,Isnt that a bit too strong?
1593605399.0,2,That's like a $60-120 prescription medication?
1593622275.0,2,"I'm also a fan of the Benton fermentation eye cream (it's my morning eye cream), and the only other cream I have found that's as good is Sulwhasoo concentrated ginseng renewing eye cream. This is my night cream and I definitely notice a difference if I run out. This plumps up the skin around my eye and makes fine lines less noticeable. This is thicker and more moisturizing than the Benton, which is why I use it at night."
1593626200.0,1,Buffer/buffering means you don‚Äôt apply the product directly on bare skin but apply a thin layer of moisturizer/serum first then apply the product.
1593607839.0,23,"I‚Äôm glad to be of help!! We need to be intelligent consumers. My advice would be to just use your moisturizer around the eyes as well (preferably fragrance-free), and apply/ reapply sunscreen during the day"
1593705936.0,1,"u/mirunamm27 

This reminds me of lip care-- you don't need a lip balm either. Don't fall for marketing strategies. Face/body moisturizers work for your lips just fine /s.  
(but really unless your lips are sensitive to your face products your face moisturizers generally can work just fine on your lips)

Eye creams generally have the highest concentration of the key points in the skincare line that it is in, which is why it's so expensive. 

Sure companies like to market them as another step to get us to buy them, but it's not a gimmick. Not everyone *needs* an eye cream, but depending on your skin condition, the other products you use, your skincare goals... you may need a separate product your your eyes whether it's marketed as an eye cream or not.

Some moisturizers can be too strong for the under eye area (ex. milia causing, redness, etc.) so it's good to remember that YMMV for face cream as eye cream."

I love sunscreen but I have skipped it for daily wear since I started WFH full-time due to covid. I don't see the point of putting it on everyday if I'm not close to a window and I'm  only outside for a quick evening walk, with a hat on."
1593610981.0,22,"Yesss, definitely!! The UVA rays don‚Äôt really care if you‚Äôre inside all day haha:)) wearing sunscreen should be a habit, just like brushing your teeth. Jusy apply it every day, rain or shine, and future you will thank you üòÅ"
1593614605.0,11,"What I found is that some sunscreens are simply impossible to wear around the eyes, so the only thing you can do is find one that‚Äôs comfortable enough for that area. Mineral sunscreens tend to be well tolerated around the eyes. I personally use the la roche posay invisible fluid (european version) and it‚Äôs great around my eyes as well (it‚Äôs not a mineral sunscreen, but it‚Äôs my favourite so far)"

1593625103.0,1,Can you explain what a buffer/buffering is? The term is quite new to me :)
1593617193.0,3,"Definitely not. The only issue is that some sunscreens sting really badly when worn around the eyes, so if you really enjoy that particular product for your face but is uncomfortable for the eyes, then you might need one that doesn‚Äôt sting, as it‚Äôs very important to protect the eye area as well"
1593673809.0,1,"If you don‚Äôt go out, I think it‚Äôs fine to apply it just twice a day: in the morning & in the afternoon, as it will inevitably wear out"

1593617130.0,2,Maybe try Japanese brands for fragrance free. I‚Äôve neen thinking anout trying a dhc one -they‚Äôre midrange but effective.
1593727455.0,1,Yeah I have seen a reduction in super fine lines and less dark circles although they aren‚Äôt going away completely. I‚Äôve been using this tube for sooo long honestly and it just won‚Äôt get finished!! It‚Äôs been at least 5 or 6 months by now I think.
1593612461.0,1,"Yes, I've been on tret 0.025 for almost 4 months. Last month, I started to mix it with my eye cream, 3 times a week. I decided to try because I read some people had success and saw benefit from using tret for eyes. But I guess I'm not one of those people. It really dried out the skin around my eyes. Luckily, now it's getting better, with the help of suncreen and eye cream (local brand eye cream from my country). But I agree that eye cream isn't really necessary, any moisturizer free from fragrance and essential oils (and maybe alcohol) will do."
1593620679.0,1,Retinoids is the umbrella term for all derivatives. Tretinoin is retinoic acid and the active form that directly binds to the retinoid receptors on the skin. Other retinoids have to convert to retinoic acid to be effective. It goes retinol esters‚Äî>retinol‚Äî>retinaldehyde‚Äî>retinoid acid (aka tretinoin). So what I meant is that retinaldehyde is at least one step closer than retinol (which is sort of useless imo)
1593606030.0,17,I think this poster is just trying to say that the only thing that really has any ability to do some thing is retinol

1593606790.0,6,"Curology offers it. It's about $40 for two months-worth, and you also get consultation with a dermatologist whenever you want. It also includes two other actives, depending on what you're wanting. I swear by it."

1593607516.0,2,"My Tret was only $32! And the appointment to see my derm was like $30 co-pay as well? I can't remember, it was definitely pretty affordable though"
1593612433.0,2,"Just sayin, Tretinoin costs me $6 a (large) tube with my prescription through my insurance. So long as you say you‚Äôre using it for acne, insurance companies often cover it.

And I second Tretinoin. I honestly think it‚Äôs the only topical thing that prevents/reduces wrinkles."
1593621454.0,2,Not rx or expensive in many countries.
1593611344.0,1,"Imagine how long it would take you to get through a tube if you were using it as eye cream. It'd be well expired before you got through it. The dose is 'a pea sized amount for the whole face'. Plus if you go by price per ml compared to eye creams it's not even pricey. Not that I'm suggesting any tret newbs to put it on their eye area (DON'T GUYS), just commenting on the price."
1593624998.0,1,"Me too thsts why i never use it, i rarely open my curtains too.."

1593725742.0,2,"Yeah, sounds like you over exfoliated. I would stop using the BHA for at least 2 weeks, focus on hydrating + moisturizing. Once your skin is back to its old self, I would slowly introduce the BHA again (like once a week for maybe 2-3 weeks? Depending on how your skin feels). After that, keep your exfoliating to 1-3 times a week."
1593697901.0,6,"Take my comment with a grain of salt b/c I'm in my 20s. But as far as I can tell, the AB philosophy really does focus on prevention. This means using sunscreen regularly and avoiding prolonged sun exposure. Realistically it is difficult to treat wrinkles, particularly deeper ones, once they've already formed without something like tretinoin. 

You could try an over the counter retinol which will be less harsh than tretinoin but potentially not as effective.

Fine lines can benefit from proper hydration & moisture which can help fill in those fine lines. This includes products with lots of humectants (very popular in AB as hydration is an important aspect of many asian approaches to skin care). Products like hada labo gokujyun premium lotion, laneige cream skin refiner, etude house soon jung toner etc. for hydration & make sure you seal that in with a nice moisturizer.

AHAs (chemical exfoliant) can also be effective for fine lines due to their exfoliating and humectant properties. Something like krave beauty kale-lalu-yAHA

Facial massage is popular but it's unclear how much it will help remove wrinkles. You can look up tutorials on it. It can be done with the hands or tools like a jade roller or gua sha. Many people like to do it during their oil cleansing stage. 

Lastly, genetics influence skin aging so it could also be that you'll inherent some of that graceful aging from your grandmother :)"
1593707069.0,2,"From experience and the internet... facial massages can/do help in many ways, but also consistency is important. It has helped me with keeping clear of acne (at least the kind caused by too much sebum-- it ends up ""pooling"" in my chin and I get lots of acne there if I am not careful)"
1593672911.0,7,"I dislike products with smell too, even if the smell isn't offensive on its own, it layers! Flowery toner + mint lip mask + tea tree oil serum and so on....it's too much! I'm from an Asian house too and I could NOT get over a eucalyptus face scrub I got, it smelled like the flu to me since my parents practically bathed me in it when I was sick!"
1593706120.0,4,"I‚Äôm actually opposite. I only like the medicine smell because it‚Äôs a comfort smell, since the scent is close to tiger balm that we use as well in our household. Any other scent in skincare makes me nauseous, especially fruity"
1593725094.0,3,I agree. The fragrance can be unpleasant or doesn't layer well. I also have the issue of it giving me migraines some times.
1593742773.0,2,I had the same experience when I opened my CosRx good morning cleanser! I'm having a difficult time getting through it because of the smell. It's pretty strong of a smell...
1593807430.0,2,"Tea tree as a scent doesn't bother me too much, just because I don't have the same association. HOWEVER, if there's one thing I will never have in my skincare lineup, it's gonna be any product with eucalyptus oil/scent. I can't! I literally just look the other way when I do find something with eucalyptus in it lmaoo"
1593895987.0,1,I personally like the smell of tea tree since I prefer woody scents compared to floral ones.
1593807511.0,1,"Not a eucalyptus face scrub, oh nooooo that's tragic (Ôºõ‚Ä≤‚åí\`)"
1593737524.0,3,I find it interesting that you associate medicinal smells with comfort. It completely makes sense! I remember feeling sick mostly so it turns me off right away. I definitely prefer fruity scents over medicine

1593680963.0,2,"https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/canmake-mermaid-skin-gel-uv/

Ratzilla does have the clear one listed here under ""Full Ingredients List."" It's listed as 01 Clear. But as per the site it's Octinoxate, TO & ZO, Uvinul A Plus, and Tinosorb S. The amount of TO in the white version is higher."
1593682650.0,2,Someone linked the ratzilla page with ingredients already but I thought I would add that it doesn't actually have a smell at all despite it looking like there's no fragrance!
1593756889.0,2,"I have used both, with clear being my HG. I must have used tens of bottles of the clear version. Once, I bought the white one by accident and it wasn't great. Not only did it pill/form white smudges over the skincare products on my skin when I first applied it over them, it made my skin look weirdly ashy on bare skin even though I'm about an N21. Again, with makeup over it, it pilled throughout the day, making it look like I was shedding skin. I would not recommend it.

The clear one however, is quite the opposite: no pilling, very inconspicuous under makeup or over skincare products, somewhat moisturising, and it gives my skin a nice glow."
1593710728.0,1,Yes I notice that they are very similar formulations. I guess I‚Äôll go with the clear
1593718308.0,2,I've tried both. I love the clear but didn't like the white version. It felt a little drying/chalky.
1593626243.0,12,"COSRX honey and rice overnight masks are some of my favourites! 

The honey one is great for hydration and plumping the skin and the rice is more for brightening and giving a glow. I would alternate both depending what my skin wants.

I have dry and sensitive skin and I didn‚Äôt feel irritated when using it."
1593629266.0,8,The Huxley good night one is amazing. I really notice the difference when I use it. It‚Äôs moisturizing but also in the summer my skin is significantly less oily in the morning. Magic!
1593624085.0,5,"Holika Holika honey sleep pack. There‚Äôs 3 versions and I have the canola one which is supposed to be good with acne prone skin. I have combination and I find this doesn‚Äôt clog pores but also hydrated.
Found it at Tjmaxx for $6 when I was panick buying after a nasty sunburn and soothed my face overnight.
Now I use it every night in place of a moisturizer 
It‚Äôs also packaged in a super cute glass honey jar."
1593625993.0,3,"I love the A'pieu Good Night Water Sleeping Pack. It's light and not greasy. It's supposed to have birch water, marine collagen, camomile and lavender extracts. I believe it's supposed.to be a dupe for Laneige. If you don't like fragrance, skip it though."
1593656568.0,3,Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Moisture Pack! Gel texture and lightweight... just hard to find especially these days :(
1593639807.0,2,"I really love the cosrx rice overnight mask! It's really hydrating but also quite moisturizing for my dry, dehydrated skin. It has a gel-cream consistency so it's not a pure gel, which I much prefer a gel-cream mask for my skin type rather than a pure gel. 

Another option that I find to be similar in texture is the skin&lab medicica calming cream which I use as either a morning moisturizer or I apply a thicker layer and use it as a sleeping mask. It also has a gel-cream consistency, and is really soothing & hydrating."
1593653610.0,2,I find Laneige WSP and Cosrx Honey way too light for me. I used up a tube of Cosrx Honey SP in under a month. FYI I have dry skin but I live in a humid climate so I can't always use heavy cream products. Much prefer Klairs Vit E Mask and Tiam Snail Azulene!
1593691130.0,2,"Laneige overnight sleeping mask (blue tub) is my HG. Oily skin here; it sinks in beautifully, and does not leave any tacky feeling after a while."
1593777887.0,1,A thick coating of meishoku ceracolla perfect gel is pretty good as an overnight gel mask. Only trouble is getting it to dry down pat.
1593919366.0,1,"pyunkang yul‚Äôs moisture ampoule as an occlusive. it‚Äôs meant to be used as a last step product so i feel like it counts as a mask??

i have combo-oily dehydrated sensitive skin and it‚Äôs oil-control properties when it seals in skincare are mAaaad. it keeps me from waking up a greaseball - to the point i can afford to only cleanse w water the following morning even if i‚Äôve used heavy/cream sleeping packs underneath. so it lets me use heavier PM products that i otherwise wouldn‚Äôt use!! 

somehow it seals in thick skincare while allowing for it to be washed off with water?? not sure what magic this is but it‚Äôs HG for sure

it‚Äôs recommended for oily/combo skin - i sometimes use this in place of a moisturiser underneath sunscreen (i apply toner/serums tho!), but i have oily skinned friends who use just this and toner under sunscreen. it‚Äôs p versatile!"
1593627018.0,5,"I love the honey mask too but sadly the rice one was too heavy for me (combination sensitive skin, easily clogged pores)."
1593626630.0,1,Is [this](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-ultimate-moisturizing-honey-overnight-mask-1.html) the honey one you use? It's one of the masks I've been looking at too.
1593648645.0,1,Do you use the mask every night?
1593650726.0,1,"can attest to the rice mask being brightening. it broke me out(guess my skin didnt like something in it) so I gave the tub to my mom instead and I told her to use it at the last step of her routine every night. after 2 weeks i noticed her skin looking hella brighter!!! she even told me that her sister(my aunt) complimented and asked her what she was using lol. however, i couldnt repurchase it for her during the quarantine and after 3 weeks without it we both noticed that the glow started fading :("
1593631574.0,2,"Ahhh I love rose scents, which apparently this one has. Am nervous about fragrance for a product that's supposed to be on awhile, but I'm adding it to the list. Are you typically oily?"
1593643447.0,1,I love this too! It‚Äôs hot where I live and sometimes I don‚Äôt sleep with AC. This mask was a nice way of ending my PM skincare^^ :)
1593631692.0,3,I had the blueberry version and it was fab. I found it in the food section of TK Maxx! Also oily skin here.
1593625148.0,1,"Thanks! I was also looking at another honey mask (Cosrx), so I'll dig into both while I'm looking around. I like the look of the canola one... on first glance, the acerola looks like it has too much vitamin-C in it to play well with some spots I'm trying to repair after a vit C overdose. üò¨"
1593626847.0,1,"I'm ok with a liiiittle fragrance, but my skin is prone to reacting when there's a lot. I love the effects of the Nature Republic watery gel, but that's the tipping point for me. Bummer, because I like A'pieu's cosmetics a lot."
1593656467.0,1,"Thanks, this is helpful! I‚Äôm oily but have some dehydrated spots and live in a humid climate. I like some of the Klairs stuff I‚Äôve tried, so I‚Äôll look into these too."
1593628869.0,2,The link doesn‚Äôt work for me D: but i got mine as a set of samples. I think the actual product packaging is in a big tube.
1593647017.0,6,"I don‚Äôt find the scent to be especially rosey, but it does have a nice, light smell. My skin is dry in winter and a bit oily in summer. I use it any time of year."
1593627137.0,3,The cosrx mask is great but doesn‚Äôt contain any actual honey. Just propolis
1593658297.0,1,"The Klairs Vit E Mask has a pudding like texture, I use it in place of my moisturizer and sleeping mask. It might look heavy due to its solid-ish texture but it's not too emollient."
1593821659.0,1,"I just bought a 15 mL of the Klairs mask for $3.. iHerb had it in their Try It! section..a dermatologist I watch said it makes a visible difference by the morning. Just wondering how true that is.

And omg I had no idea there was a Tiam snail sleeping mask!! I just looked it up and I cannot believe I didn't know about it!!! Capric/caprylic triglycerides, sunflower oil, Betaine, panthenol ..I'm drooling. Thank you so much!!!"
1593863639.0,1,"I was also intrigued by that claim, but I haven't noticed any significant / visible brightening. But I don't mind since I already use a lot of brightening skincare (ferments, Niacinamide, AHA and vitamin C).


Hehe I feel Tiam is kinda under-exposed in the community! Love the texture ‚ò∫"
1593636004.0,20,I‚Äôm not an expert but you can probably pick ones that look more natural?
1593636485.0,6,"i‚Äôve heard applying underneath your lashes disguises the lashband more, but this method is somewhat dangerous if you are new"
1593666503.0,5,"it would be helpful to see which ones you bought, but some common things I've seen people do that makes them look off are:

-  always dry measure the length of the strip and ensure that that it is the right size. Often you will need to trim the lashes and clip it from the inner corners of you want fluttery ends or both ends if you have rounded style. I used to do makeup and I've only met one model that I didn't have to trim the lashes for. 

- purchase natural hair lashes, not plastic/synthetic ones for a more natural finish. pros for synthetic is that you can clean and reuse them and they are often cheaper but they definitely don't look the same. I really like ardell wispies and red cherry lashes. 

- curl your regular eyelashes, AND the strip. it gives you the clearance to hold the lash with tweezers and it will be out of your line of sight.

- when applying, don't just try to glue to your eyelids. drop the lash on top of your natural lashes and gently push/slide it towards the lid. do this with your eye slightly open, NOT closed so the adhering strip is going to match and not change the orientation of the lash when you open your eyes.

- when you are learning use white (not black glue). it applies white, wait 5 mins or so until it's almost clear and then apply. until you get a hang of the timing I wouldn't use black glue cuz it's harder to tell. 


hope this helps."
1593637909.0,4,"I don't wear false lashes often, but when I do I only wear them under my lashline, not over. If I put them on top the lashband is visible and it just looks messy and weird, but applied under they look way more natural. I always cut the lashes in two pieces and wear them as outer lashes, because they apply easier and look natural."
1593637765.0,3,Miche bloomin make some very natural lashes. Pure sweet and pure nude for example https://www.yesstyle.com/en/miche-bloomin-eyelash-pure-line-1-pair-3-types/info.html/pid.1074097304##productAnchor
1593647238.0,2,"Run a spoolie through the lashes (horizontally, as in against the direction of the lashes) a bunch of times to make them less ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and plastic looking and more roughed up and natural. You have to be pretty rough with the spoolie to get this to work, but it can turn cheap lashes into looking like super natural, expensive mink lashes!"
1593653529.0,2,"My eyes can't handle a lot of falsies (the full volume kind; stacked; aka glam style) and this has been confirmed by two MUAs from different countries (different makeup style) lol.


Look into Korean and Japanese falsies, these are very natural and light even for me."
1593673038.0,2,"I find that almost all but the most natural of ‚Äúwestern‚Äù lashes completely overwhelm my eye (including stuff that‚Äôs marketed as natural). Part of this may be my eye shape (also Asian), as well as dramatic false lashes not working well with my facial features even if I‚Äôm going for a more dramatic makeup look. For a more natural look though, I would def recommend checking out Korean or Japanese lashes. You do have to watch out for ones that are meant for cosplay or dramatic looks, which are often identifiable with large clumps of long lashes (for example, Diamond brand and others that look like that). 

Miche Bloomin‚Äô in particular has ones that are very natural for me and was my go-to brand when I wore false lashes! They have some that are super natural (basically how mascara looks on people with nicer natural lashes) and some that are more noticeably falsies but still not as overwhelming."
1593636491.0,4,"Get the flared ardell wispies. Then cut the inner part to fit your eyes.  Wrap around your finger into a U-shape so it curves to your eyes.  Apply glue to lash strip then b4 putting glue brush back in bottle dot glue to inner and outer eye touching the lash line. Apply lash using lash tweezer that holds entire lash. (Plastic 2"" inch tweezers from eBay .99)  Press down inner & outer lash down then push down skin over the lash seam to make it look more natural. Use your finger to kind of curl lash up."
1593652902.0,1,My eye shape makes lashes look overly dramatic and fake at times too. I only wear falsies when I have matching heavy eye makeup too and it matches better. If I go for Korean style light makeup I only wear the individual pieces where you put a few at the corners.
1593661167.0,1,"I hate falsies. Your best bet is to go to a lash stylist who can put individual ones on and you can choose a natural look. I got it done for a wedding and LOVED it bc it fit my natural simple look perfectly, and added some curl and fullness. I can‚Äôt get any drugstore brand to work for me, be it glue or magnetic. Too fake looking and not worth the effort."
1593670591.0,1,"honestly i thought i looked crazy when i first wore falsies, but i think its because im not used to seeing myself with more than mascara. I dont have any advice but maybe you dont look as crazy as you think you do lol"
1593677492.0,1,"Honestly same for me too, I saw a AB makeup tutorial and when she said her false eyelashes were ""natural,"" I was very excited to purchase them. But when I did they looked so bad on me haha. But I think the main problem was the eyelash length is super long.. I'm not sure if it's AB but look at Doe Lashes!"
1593637467.0,10,"^^^^^ part of it is probably the style, lots of fake lashes are very understated for daily use. part of it is you‚Äôre just not used to it. trust me those folks eyes look amazing on YouTube and super extra in person too though."
1593638886.0,3,"I chose the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ones and it still looks really obvious and unnatural. My eyes are like almond shaped and I‚Äôm Asian, perhaps it‚Äôs natural for others?"
1593636253.0,3,"^^^ yes go for the natural ones and get used to wearing them until you get comfortable with it on. Over time, you‚Äôll transition to more dramatic ones if thats the style you‚Äôre going for. Ultimately, just lots of practice!"
1593639568.0,3,"I do the same! I do this only for  lashes with an invisible band, so not the thick ones. This way, they‚Äôre easier to apply and don‚Äôt weigh down your eyes"
1593638779.0,1,Can you do this with any type of lash? I‚Äôve seen the small individual ones before
1593649108.0,6,"I don't have the same eye shape as you, so I can't comment on that, but Dolly Wink has a lot of more natural lashes that you could try!"
1593662034.0,5,"I blame the brand, not you. Some of them will just slap that label on and their standards won't match everyone's (for instance I see people push the ardell demi whispies all the time and they're ridiculous on me). 

A while ago I had a pair of diamond lashes on. One of them fell off and a male friend said he could hardly tell the difference lol."
1593641073.0,3,You can try Ardell‚Äôs natural lashes if that‚Äôs available to you. Some people also use individual lashes so you can control it more
1593696591.0,1,I works with full lashes as well as individual ones. If they're really thick it might not look as natural though.

1593665053.0,2,I don't have KP but maybe you could try a product formulated with both AHA and BHA like the krave kale-lalu-yAHA or the cosrx AHA/BHA toner to get the best of both worlds
1593665499.0,2,The rovectin clean lha ampoule is the only thing that helps with texture without drying my skin out and exacerbating my kp.
1593679373.0,2,Tret helps for the ones on my cheeks but you have to supplement it with good hydrating and moisturizing products or else kp will get more obvious since skin's getting dried out. BHA and AHA freaks my skin out for some reason so I ended up with tret which my skin likes better for some reason.
1593771486.0,2,I didn‚Äôt realise I had KP on my face. I thought I had freckles that were raised lol. I used Eucerin Dry Skin Intensive. It‚Äôs got 10% urea so I can‚Äôt use it every night but I definitely noticed the bumps becoming less prominent.
1593665561.0,1,"Coincidentally just yesterday I was trying to figure out what toner is really for and it's still a little hard for me to wrap my head around...I don't want to pressure you to provide a full blown explanation for me but what would the Cosrx AHA/BHA toner do? Or what benefits come from it? It's hard for me to wrap my head around the concept of toners because I guess my mind defaults to cleanser and moisturizers being such important products  that could help my KP that toner is still a question mark to me.

But nevertheless I was just looking at Cosrx AHA/BHA toner and even though I'm still learning what each product/term entails, I'm already excited so thank you!"
1593666011.0,3,"Toners can do different things. I typically like to think of two broad categories when it comes to toners: exfoliating toners and hydrating toners.

Exfoliating toners (like the cosrx and krave ones I mentioned) contain exfoliating ingredients - typically BHAs (salicylic acid, betaine salicylate), AHAs (glycolic, lactic, mandelic acid) and/or PHAs (gluconolactone, lactobionic acid). Exfoliating will help exfoliate the skin (i.e. remove dead skin cells - AHAs are water soluble and work on the surface while BHAs are oil soluble and can penetrate the pore). I believe it's AHA that's particularly good for KP (although double check that lol)

Hydrating toners typically don't contain any actives and their primary function is to hydrate the skin (contain humectants like glycerin & hyaluronic acid to attract & hold water to the skin). 

Historically toners were used to restore the skin's pH since cleansers used to be quite alkaline and the skin is naturally mildly acidic. However, most cleansers nowadays are pH balanced so you don't really need toners for that function anymore.

Edit to add: there are also AHA and BHA cleansers out there including murad AHA/BHA cleanser and holifrog shasta AHA refining wash"

Hello, I am desperate.

I have thick, dry asian hair and need recommendations for fragrance free or at least mildly fragranced shampoos and conditioners, ideally without silicones, parabens, and sulfates.

**Here is the scoop:**

I have dry, sensitive skin.

I like formulas that do not have *drying* alcohols or any kind of fragrance (I have noticed it aggravates my sensitivity).

I like a good range of colors for fair-light complexions, and I prefer medium coverage. Full is fine, but NOT light.

I like something moisturizing and rather emollient, with a rather dewy finish (I prefer not to use setting products, alongside that). I do have COVERFX's Dewy Finish spray if needed, though.

I would prefer something that costs $30 or less for one bottle.

**OK, let's see what you guys have in mind!**

By the way, if it helps, two of my favorite foundations from the West are Physician's Formula The Healthy Foundation (sadly discontinued) and REVLON Colorstay."

I struggle with maintaining routines, so I am wanting to start off with a very simple routine (4 steps) and hopefully over the upcoming months incorporate additional items. I don't wear make-up very frequently (maybe 2-3 times a month), so I have decided against getting a first cleanser for now. 

Here is what I am thinking of purchasing:

**Second Cleanser:** The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser

**Toner:** KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner

**Moisturizer:** COSRX Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream

**Sunscreen:** Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence

Can anyone weigh in on how 'durable' or long lasting the Biore sunscreen is? I am a redhead with skin that burns very easily, so I am anticipating having to reapply very frequently (probably every 1-2 hours) when I am outside?

In addition, are there any body products anyone could recommend that might help with bacne? :( 

Thank you!"

Is there anything else I could use?"

(I honestly don‚Äôt remember it being that long.)

I was wondering if they would still be okay to use?? 
I know you shouldn‚Äôt use something too long after the expiry date... but it was over $30 and there‚Äôs still a lot left in the packet, and I hate to waste money like that.

Thoughts??

It absorbs super well; I've only used Cerave and Klairs from your tried list, and I find that FAB absorbs very quickly into my skin and doesn't leave an oily/sticky layer. You might have to check out the ingredients yourself, though!

The only downside is that it's from Sephora, costing ~$40 a tub, BUT a tub lasts me almost a year!

Apparently it's more of a concealer/coverup product?

Anyway, it has an SPF of 30 and while it wasn't what I was expecting, I still like it! It has a very light, thin consistency and it's meant for oily or combination skin and it did keep my forehead from getting overly shiny. It also looked very natural on me and wasn't streaky or anything.

So I don't know how that one compares to others, but it seems like a nice and reasonably priced product!

Edited to add: There are two other products in that line as well - there is also a ""moist"" one and a ""glow"" one and the names are probably self-expanatory. I got the matte one because I'm an oily mess and I need all the help I can get."

Actives should be used close to your skin, as products applied beforehand will act as a buffer. Depends on the active you're using, you can still have a good enough result while applying it on top of others.

In addition, as Tinosorb M is a physical/inorganic sunscreen filter it will most definitely leave a white cast. So you might be better off rethinking this particular set of requirements and seeing which is a priority."
1593690335.0,1,"Retinol and vitamin C are good actives you can look into. Depending on your budget, melano cc is a good option (it has really mixed reviews so YMMV). Both ingredients target scarring and hyperpigmentation. I suggest you start off with a vitamin C, and after around 2 weeks, you can incorporate retinol into your routine.

Vitamin C at night, once every two days first. Then maybe every night after the first week!

When you start on retinol, shift your Vitamin C to the day and retinol once every 3 days.

Vitamin C options: melano CC, goodal green tangerine, paulas choice c15 booster (this is deinitely the strongest and pricest), purito vit c serum

Retinol: tbh I personally just started on this myself, and Im using Paulas Choice retinol with bakuchiol one (supposedly more gentler than their 1% retinol). I think theres a Neutrogena night cream with retinol too? Im sure if you look for retinol recommendations, you can find some here! 

Consider adding niacinamide to the routine. The ordinary has very affordable serum as an option, and good moelcules niacinamide toner is highly recommended too. 

Last point, cosrx blackhead power liquid seems to have very high YMMV amongst people, so perhaps a AHA and BHA toner is a better option. Some By Mi AHA BHA PHA is good and affordable!

paulas choice vitamin C is my HG, and La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo+ is a good spot treatment (contains benzoyl peroxide if im not wrong) , but please do not mix this with actives! 

TLDR
AM: AHA BHA toner (once every 2 days)/ hydrating toner on days with Vit C, serum, moisturizer, sunblock (very important!) 
PM: double cleanse! (very important), toner, serum, retinol, moisturizer

PLEASE apply sunblock diligently as vitamin c and retinol makes the skin extra sensitive to the uv, and is very damaging to the skin and worsens hyperpigmentation (perhaps this the root reason for his skin problem)"

Do start out with a toner (not that important), essence/serum (if you wish to target any problem), moisturizer, and end off with a sunblock in the am. 

Toners: any hydrating toner will do

Essence/serum: your snail essence is good here

Moisturizer: you may wish to find a gel or lighter moisturizer for the day and a heavier one for evening (targets your dehydrated skin)

Sunblock: klairs soft airy sunblock or Purito unscented centella one are good options, with the latter being on the more dewy side. For a slightly more 'oily' sunblock, Biore is a good option.

To address acne issue, you can use cleansers/toners/mask with AHA BHA and/or PHA. Not sure about cleansers but some good toners and wash off masks are Some By Mi AHA BHA PHA toner, The Ordinary glycolic toner, The Ordinary 10% AHA wash off mask (last rec is pretty heavy duty so do a patch test! actually do one for all in this category)

Paulas choice website shows a routine with various of their products put together to tackle different skin problems, and their BHA is a cults favourite. You can make reference to their products and mix and match. I personally recommends PC as a brand, but it is definitely on a more pricey side!"

1593730566.0,1,"The 50+ refers to UVB protection. You can always search for whatever is labeled ‚Äúactive ingredients‚Äù on the back of the product to determine whether or not you think the individual filters are good, but formulation matters as well since some need to be stabilized in a certain way to provide good protection. 

Most 50+/PA++++ sunscreens should prevent tanning if applied and reapplied properly."
1593730146.0,2,"I wouldn‚Äôt- the dettol would get absorbed into the product, and I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt want to be applying that to your face. 

One way to sanitize (but not sterilize) a powder is to spray it with rubbing alcohol and let it dry. You can also re-press broken compact powder this way. I think the rubbing alcohol has to be in contact for at least 20 minutes to sanitize. But depending on what happened you might want to consider replacing it..."

it‚Äôs probably not hydrating enough for your dry skin though, so you could top it up with iunik‚Äôs beta glucan serum! it‚Äôs a magical combination - my skin visibly plumps immediately upon application of the beta glucan :)"
1593923938.0,2,"i have a similar skin type!

i love the biore for sebum control (i‚Äôm not sensitive to alcohol in skincare) but i can see how it could be drying without proper moisturising beneath. i prefer suncut‚Äôs super waterproof UV gel on drier days (in a 100ml bottle so i‚Äôm super chill w applying liberally), but love the biore for oilier days outdoors as well. i live in singapore so it‚Äôs hot/humid all freakin year welp

i‚Äôve tried that cleanser and it‚Äôs drying/stripping as hell, wouldn‚Äôt even use it as handwash. i recommend cosrx‚Äôs low pH good morning cleanser for end-of-day cleansing (for budget reasons, bc i don‚Äôt believe in spending on cleansers that spend a minute on your face max. i don‚Äôt usually use a cleanser in the AM)

a more budget-friendly/finish-friendly alternative for the cosrx ceramide cream is illiyoon‚Äôs ceramide cream! i‚Äôve heard the cosrx can be sorta heavy. the illiyoon is mad useful on days i don‚Äôt have time for more than 1 serum - so it might be good for your simple routine! it‚Äôs a workhorse moisturiser w a clean formula, dries down to a satin-matte finish n great for balancing sebum production. if comes in a huge 200ml tube or a 500ml tub and works fantastic as a hand/body cream too

hope this helps :)"
1593750054.0,1,"Hey! I have heard that cleanser can be quite drying, I would instead recommend the Round Lab Dokdo Cleanser or Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Cleanser.

if you‚Äôd like a lighter alternative illiyoon does have a ceramide gel or lotion option as well, i‚Äôve heard good things about the gel!"
1593660091.0,1,I have only tried the Neogen ferment essence of these but it was beautifully light and hydrating. I have very dry skin and it was perfect as a thinner layering product before denser serums.

I still have it in the back of my mind, but I wouldn‚Äôt actually purchase it unless I thought I had a compromised barrier. LG isn‚Äôt something I would want to incorporate for any other reason- I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something that I would use as a stand-alone moisturizer anyway. Just my two cents.

My current routine is fine and working, so why do I need to buy more products, right? I'll probably think about trying it once my current products ran out. 

Maybe I'm just worrying too much about my moisture barrier too. I'm currently on my 8th week of tret and my skin is actually not that bad compared to my skin before tret. My purging already stopped and only problem I have is some flaking around my mouth and nose. Also, it's the clearest and smoothest skin I have so far after struggling with acne, bumps, and other skin texture issues for years.

1593599700.0,2,"If you‚Äôre starting out I‚Äôd definitely take it slow. I agree with their advice. It also depends on the formulation. You can find vit c from 2% to 21%, BHA from 1% up... in my case daily exfoliation works better because my breakouts/inflamation are on the surface level. What helps a lot is having a bit of weekly plan. You just put up a post-it with something like: monday vit c, tuesday bha, wednesday no actives... and so on. Stick to it and adjust accordingly. One step at a time is always best üòä"
1593605233.0,2,How long have you been using the AHA? I started with once a week for a month n increase to 2 to 3 times a week after that. Got result after about a month. And I only do BHA once a week because I have dry skin.
1593609034.0,2,"It really depends on the toner you're using - if you're using astringent toners best if you do it before the acids you use. Some people also use AHA as a toner itself so it will depend as well on your own preference. 

My guide is always that you use first the low pH products before you put on the higher ones."
1593736502.0,1,"No worries! I'm not usually into luxury brands, but Sulwhasoo is really something different. Almost every product I've tried from it works so well, much to the detriment of my wallet. But if I think about all the other cheaper products I've bought to find one that works AND is a nice relaxing experience while applying, then it's definitely worth it. 

So if you don't have time/ effort to experiment on products, Sulwhasoo is definitely my shortcut recommendation. 

If you need more convincing, check out fiftyshadesofsnail's blog. She has semi-mature skin and is a big fan of Sulwhasoo. Also try googling Sulwhasoo Reddit for other users' opinions. (Be warned though, you might just feel like buying everything aka what I did ü§£)"

1593601158.0,5,I'd go every 2 hours (if you're sweating a lot then 1.5ish) and also after everyone you get out of the water.
1593601104.0,2,"I can't see pH mentioned for the acid serum and cream, only ppm. The percentage is very low and if the pH of the toner is nay indication for the cream and serum, it's quite high. I can't imagine then being very good at exfoliation so they would probably be alright for the AM. The snail serum looks amazing, it has a lot of different oils (so be mindful if oil breaks you out- it might be because of this product) but it has a lot of extracts and ingredients that are good for the skin (afaik). 

You might want to try vit c for dark scars, but only after sticking to this routine for 3-6 months, to make sure the ingredients don't break you out. Obviously sunscreen bc of dark spots!

1593734209.0,1,"Excuse me for butting in, but there is no scientific evidence showing collagen supplements work. You'd be better off spending money on proper products that work for your skin, and just eating a proper diet. 

If you have dehydrated skin, start by incorporating a hydrating toner. Ones with glycerin and hyaluronic acid usually work for most people, and Hada Labo is a reasonably priced brand to start with. Do some research on reviews to see which one is suitable for you. 

I would also start using a sunscreen as UV damage can destroy the collagen in your skin and reduce elasticity. I recommend Japanese sunscreens as they have the latest UV filters, don't cost a lot and apply nicely most of the time. Skin Aqua and Nivea Sun are some common brands, again do some research to see which you would prefer."

-Klairs Freshly juiced vitamin drop. Good serum for overall improvement and sensitive skin. Better used on normal to oily skin though

-Laneige Brightdew serum. Absolute fantastic for improving skin tone and discoloration. I used it for a few years then stopped when my face is good enough to try other serums. Its also on the expensive side $55

1593622368.0,2,"I'm not sure what they mean by lighter, but the cosrx AHA is glycolic acid which is the smallest molecular size AHA, and some people can't tolerate it. It very much  depends on a person. It's good that you are starting slow (once a week). I used to got stinging when I first use it but not anymore.

U can definitely use BHA and AHA together alternately (at night). You can do AHA on weekends and BHA midweek. Once you know your skin can tolerate both products, u can alternate AHA and BHA every two days. Since you are oily, you can also use BHA twice a week and AHA once a week only. There's no right or wrong, it depends on your skin. Try to experiment and see how your skin respond. For me, when I see a lot of blackheads n clogged pores, I tend to put BHA in rotation a lot more than AHA. Otherwise I prefer AHA.

But my advice is try one product at a time first, start slow and increase frequency once your skin can tolerate it. See how your skin respond to those products. Then you can decide which ones give you the best result. Good luck :-)"

I occasionally remove a little hair from the tops of the ""arch"" as well, to balance out what I'm doing just below the arch with a brow pencil."
1593668258.0,1,"I‚Äôm not sure how much this can help, but I‚Äôve always plucked to have arched brows. I decided I wanted to grow them out at like 26. I used microneedling and castor oil on a regular basis. It definitely helped (I thought they might be a lost cause since I had been plucking for almost 15 years), but it was still very clear where the old plucking started. What helped me the most was using careprost (I got it from ReliableRxPharmacy, where I get my retin a too). It was unbelievable how much it helped them grow in after only one bottle of it. Now I only use a straight razor to shape them and don‚Äôt pluck. This way I can try out different shapes, and I‚Äôm loving the straight n short brow look!"
1593676755.0,1,"I can relate haha, my eyebrows are naturally angry triangles so I have to shape them quite a bit. I'd recommend drawing out the shape you want first with an eyebrow pencil. I like to pluck below and shave above, because I generally find that the hairs at the top of the arch are thinner and I don't want to take away from the volume if that makes sense. I still think it's nicer to keep some of my natural arch shape because that's what's individual to me. Overly shaped brows can look a bit off in the context of your whole appearance."
1593705354.0,1,"My eyebrows are naturally somewhat straight, but have an arch at the bottom. I know most makeup enthusiasts will tell you to comb your eyebrow hairs up with a spoolie, but in the place where my arch tends to be highest, I actually brush down! That way the bottom looks more even (this works better if you have longer haired eyebrows). It stays in place all day, especially if you use a brow gel to keep them down. I brush the rest of my eyebrow up so it looks straighter in comparison."
1593717161.0,1,"I‚Äôm not as helpful as some other comments but I grew out my brows and plucked until they were general straighter. Like if the tail is why it‚Äôs arched, remove the tail and focus on volumizing the rest by letting them grow in. Eventually, they become easy to tell that this is your new shape. But if you go to get threaded or waxed(in a non COVID-19 situation) you should still specify to them what you want. I‚Äôve had frustrating ladies try to shape my brows into angled brows even after I tell them NOT to do that."
1593644542.0,1,"Thanks, I'm going to try this"

1593603295.0,5,"**Good news:** Rom&nd‚Äôs limited edition shades of their zero gram lipsticks are (permanently?) part of the lineup following the packaging renewal! Meaning the pretty MLBB Sunset Edition shades are available again. 

**Bad news:** I spent the last few weeks scouring the internet for the sunset shades and found them, but including shipping for buying them all individually from different sites, it probably cost me about double the original cost of the lipsticks and two were secondhand sales. Which, up until seeing the new shade lineup today, was totally fine with me as they were limited edition products. I just wish I had known they were going to be sold again, ugh. :(

I hope that qualifies as a rant, haha. I guess to make my post more relevant, I recently opened up my **Innisfree Apple Seed Cleansing Gel** which I had stashed for a while and man it is DRYING.

Today is just a disappointing AB day for me, lol. :("
1593632635.0,1,"Rant: I've been patch testing the newly formulated Etude House Moistfull Collagen Deep Cream. I tried out some samples of the original formula and really liked it but didn't have a spot for it in my routine. I bought the full product and started testing it this week and oh.my.god. IT STINKS. 
I've never been sensitive to fragrances and never went out of my way to avoid them but this cream has a very overpowering old lady floral smell. I'm still patch testing it and I can smell it an hour later after putting it on. 
It's only been a few days so haven't seen any noticeable changes but even if this product gave me Instagram-able skin, I'd be hesitant to continue using it just because of the scent alone. I haven't tried any of the other collagen products so I can't say if they're stinky too."
1593484446.0,641,"yeah, YesStyle tends to list things as a high price so they can make it look like they're giving you a really good ""sale"" offer, pretty much at all times. prices and their discounts change around on there frequently, though in the end you're usually still getting products at a competitive price, especially with membership discounts, actual sales that they have, and any promo codes you use."
1593484917.0,224,yeah they do this all the time. list the regular price as something hugely falsely inflated so they can put it on sale for a very very minuscule discount compared to the real price so they can pretend it‚Äôs a way better deal than it actually is
1593499077.0,185,"Ugh, YS are so ridiculous idek if I shouldn't be sharing this info but... I was working for a Korean skincare brand up until the COVID outbreak and was responsible for our overseas channels including YS. The contact person/team at YS literally had no idea how to price our products, despite me sending them full list of our recommended retail prices. They would always set the prices either ridiculously low (when we added new products) and then I would spend weeks going back and forth with them to get them to fix the prices -- at which time they would almost always make the prices higher than what we listed. Absolute mess, each time. I can't imagine what a mess their customer service must be."
1593493798.0,60,"Yesstyle does this all the time. I remember once they had a 80 or 90% off sale and they tried to claim the original price of an Etude House lip tint was $56 üò≠

Also the first time I noticed that they did this was because I had taken a screenshot of a $5 Shrek lip balm because I found it funny, and later while I was browsing the site when they had a 10% off sale, the Shrek lip balm was still $5 but the ‚Äúoriginal price‚Äù was now $5.50."
1593490909.0,116,"YesStyle does this a lot unfortunately - really shady. If you‚Äôre looking into the PY essence toner but don‚Äôt want to use YesStyle, I got mine on OhLolly! It‚Äôs a reputable site for K-Beauty."
1593492249.0,25,"Recently I switched to iHerb, there are a couple other decent competitors out there too. Worth your time to surf to compare pricing first."
1593495427.0,23,"I see this happening a lot, not just on Yesstyle but generally on online shops. I also saw many physical shops have incredible high ‚Äúsales‚Äù 24/7 when I was in Korea, which made it pretty likely the sale price is simply the actual price for the item, because a bunch of shops were ‚Äú80-90% off on everything‚Äù the entire two weeks I was there.

That tactic is used to make people feel like they‚Äôd be missing out if they don‚Äôt buy right now. It‚Äôs always best to match the prices on other websites before buying, especially since yesstyle has big sales basically every other week and you‚Äôll most likely get the same price again soon. These sales often end up being *slightly* better than usually anyways, but it really just by a couple of bucks, typically 10-20% off the original base price. Sometimes the price on sale is a little higher than the usual base price though, so make sure to match! I‚Äôve seen the same being done on Jolse, even though not as often and not as obvious."
1593485393.0,75,Customers are getting taken advantage of because not everyone has the patience to search other sites for a cheaper price when they are already familiar with YesStyle / trust them and when they say products are on sale. It's a common online marketing tactic.
1593522000.0,11,"So I have a funny story: 
I ordered the Klairs sheet masks with the order, their app said $4.41 so I adjusted the total to fit the free standard shipping to $35 (no tracking code). But I got charged $3.75 per mask so my total was $33, and I ended up paying the $5 shipping. I sent them an email saying I got screenshot of the app order (I always take one before I purchase) and asked them to refund the $5. They did refund with a coupon and their reason was ""changed due to the sale promotion on (Date). Kindly note that product prices may change at any time without notice for sale items"". 
Heck it was a THURSDAY, not the usual Tuesday when they change their weekly ""sales"". 
Later I observed that sometimes the prices are lower towards the weekend.

They do this all the time. Sometimes they increase their prices during sales and promotion code days so you'll still buy them at the original price. I've purchased the PKY toner 3 times from them, twice it was $15.44, once it was $16.13. I monitor prices and wait till it hits the lowest before ordering, unless I'm running out of stuff. 

That being said, YS do have genuine sales like the Black Friday sales, I managed to buy a Klairs moisturizer with a $12 discount, even without a promo code. But most are just 'sales' with whacky names and no real benefit.  

I live in a place where most businesses don't ship to or I have to pay more for shipping (like StyleKorean) than the product price listed, having to pay no shipping cost when purchasing above $35 is kind of a blessing I guess. We don't have kbeauty stores here except for Face Shop that doesn't feature the whole collection of goods. But we do have Instagram businesses where people get stuff down (sometimes from YS) and sell it with a $5-$10 increased price tag. So I got no choice other than YS."
1593499943.0,8,Yesstyle does this with all products. Check out stylekorean or wishtrend. I‚Äôve heard rose rose shop is good too but haven‚Äôt used it yet. I like stylekorean but has only Korean products. Wish there were more websites where I could find Japanese and/ or Korean products with decent prices and good shipping.
1593505480.0,9,"First time I used yesstyle I bought a pair of shoes that apparently was ¬£80 reduced to ¬£16, it look nice so I bought it and the quality was so bad. It had the cheap material smell and the packaging was just with plastic wrap. So I think they markup their prices on everything, sometimes it is better than places like eBay or amazon if you‚Äôre buying beauty products but don‚Äôt believe the clothes haha"
1593508047.0,7,"Yea, I really think they exaggerate their pricing .. much like Aliexpress so they can offer you 'this sick deal until xx date"".

I've only just made my first purchase on Yesstyle for the PMEL Mascara base, and they're the only store online that had it for a reasonable price (apprx. $30 AU). Amazon and Ebay vendors  were selling it for over $90. Unfortunately, they would only despatch it 2 weeks from purchase date, so I decided to make the long wait worth it and picked up a bunch of cosmetics and nail art bits. 

Auspost has just received shipping info, but I don't know when I'll see it...

Stick to your local KBeauty vendors if you can. I don't think they'll sell you fakes but I'd rather pay $10-$20 more knowing it's from a legit seller. Good luck xx"
1593527794.0,6,"Pyunkang Yul is my HOLY GRAIL and I always find the 200ml on Ebay (I live in the US) for around $13-$16. And lately on the app they‚Äôve been doing $10 off $20 purchases! So it‚Äôs free shipping (takes like 2-5 days) PLUS a great deal! I don‚Äôt think YesStyle is for me unless I plan on buying like 8+ products. Check ebay, they have so much k beauty!"
1593558656.0,4,"I started shopping at YesStyle over 10 years ago, begging my dad to buy me strange hoodies with bear ears on them and other odd finds that at the time you just didn't find in the US. Back then they didn't do this trick that a lot of websites now use, I miss those days.

No instead they just had a surprisingly good price point. Clearance items would show as less. Their prices have always been really good so I don't understand why they need to zing us with that dopamine sale hit or whatever. Then again, yes I do. It's worked so well for other sites and keeps customers coming back.

It is a shame though because I'm not interested in rock bottom prices (even though they basically are!) I am at YesStyle for the same reason I was there 10 years ago. Their selection is STILL hard to find, and now they even ship free. Now whenever I see too many price slashes on products I am leery that they are using this trick. And it instantly lowers the site's value in my eyes."
1593493489.0,8,"Yea they do this.

I am so upset with the 25$ shipping fee but I understand because covid times, still, big sigh, the situation is the same for a lot of websites and on jolse shipping would cost me 40 bucks!"

Of course I‚Äôm going to order from Ulta because I live in the United States so I get cheap or free shipping that is reliably fast, rewards points, and cash back from whatever they call ebates now.

Compare that with $13.99 shipping from YesStyle. Sure I get 6% off because of their discount program but it‚Äôs not worth it."
1593507834.0,4,I'm definitely not defended Yesstyle's practices but I definitely do get genuinely awesome deals on there all the time.
1593517972.0,2,"This is why I stopped using YesStyle, they do this all the time. For UK people I now use StyleVana and its so much better, the shipping is quicker too."
1593531077.0,2,"Yeah, that sounds like YS. I just keep track of price points for my HG products, so their constant changes don't skew my perception. I don't see it as any different than the ""loss leader"" nonsense that grocery stores pull."
1593536960.0,2,"They always do that, they would jack up the ""regular"" price and then give it a 80% off to make it look like a great deal.  I've seen it where their pre-discounted price changes all the time on a lot of items.  I mean they still have good deals on a lot of things, but I would take their ""80% SALE"" (etc) with a grain of salt.  

Make sure you review on all your purchased items to get 1000 style points (whatever it is called) and boost your status to the highest because you'll get additional 10% off on everything. I think it's 100 points per review."
1593515653.0,1,yes yesstyle do this.

I was extremely interested in getting this toner and when I saw the price after discount I made a huge cart with a few of the Pyunkang Yul products I wanted to try and some delicious snacks and other stuff also but then when I logged in, the coupon went away because apparently I made an order years ago and the discount doesn‚Äôt apply. But it was good that it happened that way, I need to get on a no-buy! I have all the skincare I need now. I‚Äôll buy the Pyunkang Yul stuff when I run out of my current stuff."
1593499270.0,11,"From experience, when a K-Beauty brand sets prices for products, they take into account that it has to be on ""sale"" in order to sell.  
IE. if the production cost of a sheet mask is 500KRW, you might assume that it would sell for 3000KRW. However, the brand will list the official price at 4000KRW - because they know once the product hits shelf they will have to add a ""sale"", maybe 20%, in order to entice consumers. With the added sale, the product sells for 3200KRW - the brand still earns the 3000KRW that they wanted while the consumer thinks they made a good deal...."
1593490605.0,32,"True, for shipping to Australia I found South Korean sellers on eBay almost always cheaper than YesStyle pre COVID-19. Now shipping from the sellers is $15-30AUD for one product so YesStyle works out cheaper."

1593535985.0,9,"Suppliers to retailers within Europe can actually legally state and recommend their ‚Äòrecommended retail prices‚Äô aka RRPs to the retailer.

Normally, RRPs are actually a good recommended pricing format, as you wouldn‚Äôt want to go too high or too below this price as it could affect how the customers see value within your brand. What would normally happen is a supplier or brand advises the RRP and then the retailer would price around that. Although they‚Äôd never usually sell an item higher than its RRP. 

What isn‚Äôt legal and goes against EU competition law, is when a supplier states that you have to price an item at a certain selling price. 

Selling price vs recommended price are very different things when you discuss these things as a supplier. 

A supplier can legally say they have a fixed RRP, but it‚Äôs illegal for them to say their selling price is fixed. The selling price is at the complete discretion of the retailer."

**peripera ink the airy velvet (NEW) 02 selfie orange brown**: oowie what a beautiful colour, it‚Äôs quite pigmented but can be blended out for a nice blurred look! if i‚Äôm feeling really orange i will use this!

**laka watery sheer lipstick claude**: a sheer moisturising lipstick texture, for more natural days and looks :) the colour can still be built up if you want it to be more pigmented! 

**etude house better lips talk velvet be119 orange bianco**: a vintage orangey brown colour which is quite muted so it looks natural and mlbb! i love this shade, it doesn‚Äôt stand out too much yet gives some colour to your lips! 

**apieu juicy pang tint CR02**: i really like this formula! it‚Äôs quite light but there is still a gloss and it‚Äôs really comfortable on the lips :) this colour has a little bit of red in it and it‚Äôs a toned down colour too so it isn‚Äôt too bright!

**romand glasting water tint 03 brick river**: oddly enough, this has the same flowery soapy scent as the peripera ink airy velvet but this lingers on more as you can taste it since it‚Äôs a glossy lip :o anyway the colour is a nice orangey reddish brown that can be more intense if you apply full lips!"
1593633757.0,1,the romand one looks so nice!! i'm currently trying to decide which romand lip products to get and it's so hard to decide ><
1593636758.0,1,Thanks for the reviews! I wish I could find orange colours that were more yellow toned in AB rather than brown or red. They always end up looking bright red or brown on my warm skin!
1593673048.0,1,romand lip products are really great! not to mention they just released 30 new colours... oh man
1593683003.0,1,30?! I thought it was just a few from their new shell nude collection :O do you know where I can see what the shades are?

1593551482.0,2,"Addiction by Ayako is a high end Kose brand that I‚Äôve wanted to try for years but it‚Äôs a little annoying to order from the states. I ordered from everglowcosmetics.com and they shipped with DHL and it got here super quickly. They have a markup though, with each eyeshadow being $25 when I think they retail for $20. The eyeshadows are buttery soft and apply smoothly. Flash Back and Never Land go on more pigmented and smoothly, as metallics tend to do. Mariage is a sheer champagne gold glitter. Pictured are several swipes as it doesn‚Äôt pick up heavily, which I like because glitter tends to be intense. Flash Back is a beautiful metallic taupe, which I have a bunch of but I can‚Äôt resist pretty taupes. Londolozi is a matte mauve rose that is also not super pigmented but great on a blending brush for a soft crease. Never Land is a metallic medium emerald green."
1593564514.0,2,"Neverland is so pretty! I  have a few of her singles (nowadays the brand is directed by Kanoko/not sure who that is, while texture are still great, the colors look more generic now ) and Ayako really excels at making greyish cool toned shades that's super wearable."
1593567135.0,1,"Yeah I noticed that, I wanted more exciting colors because they are great quality and it‚Äôs a little hard to get but it‚Äôs still good to get shades i will use more often. I‚Äôll have to watch out for seasonal collections instead!"

1593538168.0,38,"I bought it, and it's okay in the way that every single not-terrible eye cream is okay. It hydrates, it's not heavy or greasy. That's about it. 


I used it twice a day for a few weeks and wasn't blown away. No effect on fine lines or dark circles, not even temporarily. I'm personally of the opinion that if your current routine is hydrating enough, and your face cream isn't so heavy it's giving you milia, you don't need a separate eye cream.



The reason everyone's constantly on the search for an HG eye cream is because basically none of them do more than hydrate lol. If you want to address crepey skin, use one with retinol. If your undereye is puffy, try one with caffeine. Otherwise there's no miracle cream.



----


It's not bad, it hydrates nicely and it's light on the skin. It's also pretty cheap for the volume you get. Just have realistic expectations about what an eye cream can do for you."
1593551726.0,15,"I feel Iike the true test of a product happens when you run out and notice that your skin isn‚Äôt looking as good as it was when you were using it. I didn‚Äôt have that experience with this eye cream. Once I stopped using it I realized I didn‚Äôt miss it, and I didn‚Äôt notice a difference in the appearance of my under eye area. I didn‚Äôt feel like it did much for me, even the very basic function of moisturizing. 

My two favorite eye creams are the Etude House moistfull collagen and the Secret Key starting treatment rose eye cream. The Etude House one gives instant results. It plumps the skin right up and fills in those fine lines as soon as you apply. The Secret Key is one that falls into the you notice what it was doing for you once you stop using it category. It brightens and smooths fine lines over time. It is scented with a strong rose scent though, so could be a miss for people who are sensitive to fragrance near their eye area."
1593558453.0,3,"It is a nice cream. I didn't notice any difference in my fine lines, but still I think it is hydratating."
1593558690.0,2,It's not bad and didn't irritate or be too greasy. No eye creams have changed anything that whatever I use on my face doesn't do. This was the same. If an eye cream is too heavy it makes me puffier. This didn't. I liked it. It is not game-changing.
1593564290.0,2,"define ""work."" is it a moisturizer? yes. will it hide your dark circles or disappear your wrinkles? no."
1593569522.0,2,"I agree with the people in the comments. The eye cream was more of a moisturizer around the eye area and it did not irritate my eyes but in terms of dark circles and wrinkles, it didn't do much. It's not greasy either."
1593570685.0,2,It did a nice job for me. Not too heavy but not too light either.
1593592356.0,1,I really like it as i have ultra sensitive skin and eyes and it is the best cream i have found it is not greasy or oily and the moisture really lasts an alternitive would be all about eyes from clinique but it is a bit more irritaring for me
1593539443.0,4,Well said.
1593583668.0,3,"This is on point. 

I'm going to add to this that many eye creams are moisturisers with a very small amount of actives (retinoids/niacinamide/caffeine etc.) in it. It's therefore gentler for the eye area. 

If you've got a moisturiser that doesn't give you milia or irritate the skin around the eye area and the actives necessary to target your concerns on hand, you can try mixing a small amount into the moisturiser."
1593829341.0,2,Some very good points
1593595687.0,6,"Hello everyone!

Just received my [YesStyle Summer Sale haul](https://imgur.com/NqFpbgH). The Ordinary products were sold out everywhere so decided on a complete Asian skincare routine. I make online purchases every 6 months so I tend to stock up on products and that‚Äôs why this may look excessive (looking at you [r/SCACircleJerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCACircleJerk/))‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm 23 F, NC 30, located in a hot and humid climate dealing with bad summers. My skin type is normal (oscillating between dry and oily on bad days).

FTP - First Time Purchase

RP - Repurchase

HG - Holy Grail

From the top-right‚Äî

1. I‚Äôm From Honey Mask (FTP)
2. I‚Äôm From Mugwort Mask (FTP) - Currently don‚Äôt have any masks in my arsenal so thought I‚Äôd try out these highly raved masks. They are supposed to contain up to 5 uses each.
3. For Back Herbal Citrus soap (FTP) - Hot and humid climate is lending itself to sweat rashes. Read good reviews.
4. Purito Galacto Niacin 97 Power Essence (FTP) - First venture into Galactomyces and ferment ingredients formulated with 92% Galactomyces ferment filtrate and 5% Niacinamide. This will be replacing the TO Niacinamide.
5. Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum (Scented) (RP) - Good for use after chemical peels and acne spot treatment (Epiduo). Scented was cheaper than unscented and I‚Äôm not sensitive to fragrance.
6. Kose Softymo (Speedy) Cleansing Oil (FTP) - This will be replacing my Klairs Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil because its cheaper.
7. CP-1 Head Spa Scalp Scaler (FTP) - I‚Äôm a huge believer in scalp health. I deal with scalp acne in summers. This will be replacing the Christophe Robin Sea Salt Purifying Scrub which seemed slightly harsh.
8. Curesys Trouble Clear Microneedle Patches (FTP) - Cheaper than ZitSticka. I deal with one or two blind cystic acne which scar badly (even without picking) during my periods. Will try to gauge efficacy.

From the bottom-right‚Äî

1. Biore UV Athlizm Essence (FTP) ‚Äî Would like this to replace LRP Shaka Fluide as a water-resistant and sweat-proof sunscreen. The LRP sunscreen has enough alcohol to be troublesome to me when I‚Äôm dealing with sensitive skin.
2. Rohto Melano CC Essence (RP) ‚Äî Use it as a spot treatment fort PIH. Was told a repurchase is necessary to see results. I will give it another try.
3. Isntree 8% AHA Essence (FTP) ‚Äî 4% lactic acid and 4% glycolic acid. To replace the out of stock TO AHA BHA peel.
4. Iunik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum (FTP) ‚Äî I liked the way using a propolis mask made my skin look. This is a vanity try.
5. Tiam Vita B3 Source (FTP) ‚Äî 10% Niacinamide and 2% Alpha Arbutin to kill 2 TO birds with one stone. I will be missing the zinc though.
6. Holika Holika Good Cera Emulsion (RP, HG) ‚Äî Use this as a moisturizer both in the AM and PM. Keeps the skin barrier in top shape!

I will be starting with the Tiam Vita B3 serum (AM), Iunik serum (PM), the I‚Äôm From masks, the herbal soap, the scalp scaler, the cleansing oil, and the microneedle patch. Do let me know if you‚Äôd like a review of any of these products. I'll do a review post then."

It‚Äôs receiving great reviews and the design is fantastic so I‚Äôm about to cave. Seriously go look at it, it‚Äôs so pretty. I‚Äôve been looking for a website shipping to the US but friggin Gmarket how did you know I was looking for this? Gmarket never emails me but they did today, with a coupon for THIS cushion. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna cave

The matte cushion case is mint, and there is also a glowy cushion that is pink case."
1593635678.0,3,Please review the Isntree 8% AHA Essence when you have a chance to use it! I'm currently using the CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid and was looking at other alternatives once I finish.
1593636709.0,1,I would love a review of the kose softymo speedy oil and melano CC treatment! Those are currently on my wishlist üò≠
1593637176.0,1,I‚Äôm interested what you think of the athlizm. I just started using the Shaka fluid since my Japanese Nivea was not sweat resistant enough. I dont find the alcohol irritating but didn‚Äôt go with the athlizm because of strong fragrance (I‚Äôm not sensitive either I just didn‚Äôt want to gamble on a scent that reviews said was intense and I might not like.
1593793522.0,2,I wish I had seen this a week ago when I placed my order for a bunch of ab stuff. I went with the moonshot micro
1593669196.0,2,"For the Melano CC: I think it worked, but up to a point. I don‚Äôt need Vit C for brightening, etc but I‚Äôm trusting its ability to reduce PIH. When I raised the limited efficacy point on another subreddit, I was suggested to try it out for longer.

I like the packaging and formulation because Vit C formulations are very finicky. The packaging keeps it safe from oxidation and the product wears and sinks into the skin well.

Hope this was useful :)"
1593669223.0,1,"I‚Äôll do a patch test soon and will update you!

Update: It does have a strong scent upon initial application but dissipates soon after. It forms something of a barrier on the skin i.e it won‚Äôt sink into the skin so it‚Äôs not very cosmetically elegant. No white cast. Will require an oil cleanser to remove.

I hope this was somewhat helpful :)"

1593544385.0,4,I wish I didn't have to care about these things. Alcohol I can sometimes tolerate depending on the formula... but fragrance and essential oils will make my eyes swell up and burn even if I use it elsewhere on my face and my skin stings all day and turns beet red. I also break out in painful cystic acne and itchy pimples if I use anything with niacinamide in it so that makes things even more difficult.

Most of them contain biotin, castor oil and other hyped ingredients. These products will not work and can possibly cause more harm like clogged pores where the eyelashes are which can swell the eye or introducing new irritants to that area.

There is only 1 medication that is FDA approved (US) to actually grow lashes. It‚Äôs a side effect of glaucoma medication called Bimatoprost (generic) or Lumigan (brand). It‚Äôs been changed and rebranded as lash grow medication called Latisse. Once you start using it you should not stop because your lashes will fall out.

1593469059.0,-1,Vitamins
1593463268.0,20,Did castor oil make a significant difference for you? I‚Äôve been using it for multiple weeks now and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worked a little bit or I‚Äôm imagining things?
1593464781.0,9,"Wanted to say when I was using castor oil for my eyebrows/eyelashes for a while, it realllly helped with growth!!! I need to get back into it but it's definitely worth buying"
1593482296.0,1,"Yes to castor oil! I‚Äôve used latisse, careprost & several other prostaglandin lash serums in the past. I got good results but they all gave me dark lids, I looked tired all the time! I don‚Äôt think the side effects are worth it. And somehow, since it‚Äôs a drug, after around 2 years of using them, they stopped working for me. My lashes slowly went back to their original length & thickness.

I have now switched to castor oil (clean, healthy, cheap) & surprisingly it works for me! As someone who has used latisse before, I really had low expectation but I noticed growth after about a week! I was shocked bc with latisse, it took me 2-3 months to notice a change. I think that‚Äôs bc latisse works by extending your lash growth cycle while castor oil works by actually stimulating growth. I‚Äôve been applying castor oil to my lashes with my fingers every night for almost a month now & my lashes are definitely noticeably longer & i‚Äôm noticing new lash growth! It‚Äôs definitely part of my routine now & I plan to keep it in my routine permanently. HG for sure.

Also, tbh I don‚Äôt think it works for everyone. It‚Äôs worth to mention that I‚Äôm southeast asian & my natural lashes are not at all short or thin. I remember one time when I was 14 I caught conjunctivitis in my left eye & I was prescribed this eyedrop & eye ointment by my gp. After about a week, the lashes on my left eye were significantly longer than the other! It was weird even my friends commented on it. Looking back, I think the moisturizing ingredients in the ointment or drops make my lashes grow. I guess my lashes are easy to grow. Castor oil is cheap! Everyone should give it a try & see if it works for you."
1593537868.0,1,"Castor oil made my eyelashes stronger and stay curled for longer. However, I don‚Äôt think I saw much growth :("
1593460206.0,14,It works for me! I heard a lot of negative things about it but I‚Äôm glad my friend gifted it to me.
1593463646.0,3,"Also didn't work for me, I really really wanted it to though! I used it religiously every morning and night for over a month and saw no results, the bottle also got really sticky and I was starting to question how sanitary it was haha. I've just been using the Heroine Make Mascara which makes a huge difference, I've had friends ask me if it was falsies or extensions."
1593473131.0,1,Worked for me personally. Really sad that I lost mine and my mom lost hers and I can't buy it anymore :(
1593476184.0,1,"Same‚ÄîI like it as a super light brow gel. But I also bought it from amazon before I learned about how rampant fakes are there, so who knows what I‚Äôm smearing on my face"
1593465175.0,2,"I'm currently using the DHC one and I've nearly finished. I didn't find a difference length wise, but my eyelashes do seem stronger and fall out less? It's fairly inexpensive so I would suggest giving it a try too"
1593503738.0,1,"Tried this and it did absolutely nothing. Then again, I‚Äôve got terribly stiff and short lashes so I haven‚Äôt been hopeful about finding anything that works for it :/"
1593589268.0,1,I use this and it‚Äôs made a huge difference to my eyelashes!! I also noticed that using oil cleaners also strengthened and made my eyelashes longer + more in quantity. My eyelashes barely fall out anymore and are no longer brittle!
1593488599.0,1,I have it and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have done anything at all. But I‚Äôll admit that I don‚Äôt use it consistently.
1593484693.0,4,They don't *all* fall out at once. Just the extra hairs the medication grows. Ive been on it and then stopped and nothing crazy happened
1593478126.0,1,I always go for fake lashes so it severely damaged my natural lashes. With the quarantine I can say that my eyelashes are better now but with sparse spacing. I then decided to instead take care of my natural lashes instead of going for the artificial ones. Will look into Latisse. Thank you!
1593491742.0,1,"Lash serums use synthetic versions of Bimatoprost, the main ingredient in Latisse. Two popular lash serums are Lash Boost and Babe Lash and they use Isopropyl cloprostenate. They also can have worst side effects than Latisse tho since it's not FDA regulated. The use of the same wand in a tube isn't as hygienic and that's what causes the clogged pores. Lash Boost currently is in a lawsuit for increased eye infections."
1593543968.0,1,Seconding this! It totally works for me and is dirt cheap!
1593466677.0,20,"Most of these serums are meant to strengthen the lash so it won‚Äôt break or fall out as easily. We damage our lashes quite often by rubbing our eyes, curling them, etc. So oils, peptides, etc.

When you‚Äôre looking for ingredients that actually do something, you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúbimatoprost‚Äù ‚ÄúHydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans‚Äù, things related to this. These ingredients help extend the ‚Äúlife cycle‚Äù of your natural hair so instead of dropping out after 4 weeks, it‚Äôll just keep growing until it can‚Äôt anymore, and stay. It‚Äôs originally something they found out after people with glaucoma started treatments, and reported to have grown insane eyelashes. These ingredients do often give a side effect of darker eye areas (dark circles and dark eyelid), and even cause some slight tinge of yellow to the whites of your eyes."
1593465655.0,3,They‚Äôre not worth it imo because you have to keep applying it constantly because lashes fall out often like any other hair so you need to be really on it for any benefits.
1593467086.0,5,"(I live in the US) Not as a growth medication. If a company we‚Äôre to make those claims in the US it has to be tested and FDA approved. I have yet to see any claims of that from AB products being sold here through resellers like Ulta, Sephora. I personally wouldn‚Äôt invest in any of these products mentioned. 

If you buy it here in the US it‚Äôs called Latisse (Lumigan is the brand by drug company Allergan). It is an FDA regulated medication to grow lashes. You have to get a prescription by a dermatologist or your doctor. It‚Äôs original use was medication for glaucoma but the side effects were hair growth from eyelashes. The one problem is if you stop using it you will lose your eyelashes. Here‚Äôs a [Canadian Medical Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185096/) about it."
1593464051.0,1,"My guess is that, by applying a lash serum, you're strengthening your eyelashes so it won't break off as easy => Fuller lashes. Also oil helps lengthen, kinda the same idea with hair + shampoo"
1593530686.0,2,i don't know. doesn't work for me. i use it for years but my lashes are still the same short.
1593494329.0,1,Same here! Waiting for responses....
1593487113.0,1,Worked for me too and I‚Äôve been using for an entire year now. It‚Äôs not as dramatic an effect as Latisse though. But also without the horrible eyelid darkening I had from Latisse so it‚Äôs a good trade off for me.
1593480900.0,1,"Can absolutely vouch‚Äî I already have thick Indian lashes and GrandeLash made them noticeably thicker to the point I had to stop using it (baby lashes even near my inner eye corners). 

Sephora sometimes has a sample with any purchase but you can also just order online and return if it doesn‚Äôt work for you. Someone also mentioned B vitamins and I agree that it can help over time, along with a good quality skin/hair/nails supplement (anecdotal, ymmv but it especially helped me with hair resilience/fallout)."
1593544266.0,1,"Seconding this! It‚Äôs the only lash serum that actually makes your lashes longer by extending the growth cycle by 2-4 weeks. Other products will only help by conditioning your lashes to keep them healthy and look fuller. I haven‚Äôt seen much of an improvement in volume, however. But I got so much length that the next time I went in for lash extensions my lash technician freaked out that they had gotten so long!"
1593469276.0,1,"I got it in Asian grocery store in nyc, it's a light gel that also doubles up as very light eye cream. I didnt use it enough to see an effect since I am on Avance last essence ex (which I like) and DHC lash tonic (doesn't lengthen but it makes them stronger."
1593463577.0,33,I honestly didn't see a difference but I was told by a friend that my lashes looked fake because they were so long. That was at the 3 month period so I think its helpful but will take a while for you to notice. I've been using it consistently for a year now and they are fuller and longer. Also castor oil is cheap and can be use for multiple things. I also use it in a hair mask and body scrub. Since I break out with coconut oil :(
1593463468.0,13,"100% works for me. I notice a dramatic difference when I apply it regularly before bed vs. when I skip for a few weeks. Not placebo at all. I'm sure you would see similar results with most oils, not just castor. Anything that conditions/strengthens the lashes."
1593479639.0,4,"I've never seen improvements from it, neither on my brows nor lashes. I applied it with a spoolie sample for months, and.... Nothing."
1593460302.0,4,Aw I'm jealous. I really wanted it to work bc it's so cheap
1593464367.0,1,Maybe the temperature caused it to get sticky? Heroine mascara is amazing! I read somewhere that japanese mascaras are very harsh and you're supposed to put on lash primer before the mascara. I don't have any primer but I use the etude house serum for primer and it works great
1593473182.0,1,Where are you from?
1593492006.0,1,I switched over to Latisse from Babe Lash. You can get a prescription from a primary doctor. Make sure you get the bigger size bottle. Use GoodRx for a coupon. I go to Walgreens and can get it for $65 after the coupon. It's a small bottle but will last about 2 months. I personally don't like the single use wands it comes with so I use an angled eyeliner brush and sanitize with rubbing alcohol before each use.
1593544474.0,1,"Mine's the other way, super thick and fluffy but just a little longer. My lashes are SO short naturally, I think it only gives a 25% increase in growth so they were never gonna go ridiculous.

My father in law actually uses it for an eye condition he has (prescribed), he has to trim his lashes as they get so long he finds it embarrassing üòÇ"
1593471787.0,1,"The friend who has used it has very short and straight eyelashes. They said it does take a while to see results, which I think is true for most skincare products, but their lashes are definitely longer and more full. It took 3 months to finish using the tube.

It‚Äôs great that you found products that work for you. Would you be interested in maybe comparing results between Avance, DHC, and matsuge biyoueki after finishing the Avance?"
1593463732.0,4,That's so cool! I check it out some more. Thanks so much :)
1593468446.0,2,How do you apply it? I keep applying too much and then it feels so heavy
1593463759.0,2,"Oh, awesome, okay I'll keep my faith in castor oil haha. thanks so much! :)"
1593468639.0,3,may i know how do u apply? I image with a cotton bud and apply to the roots/lid area? or do u apply just to the tips of the lashes?
1593481107.0,2,Dang! I guess it depends on the person maybe? I recently read an article talking about how the natural oils do help condition your lashes and thicken them but it doesn‚Äôt actually make them longer. But then a lot of people say it works.
1593461115.0,2,I know milk makeup (non asian) has a good eyelash serum but I remember it being stupid expensive :( idk many AB ones besides etude house. Edit to say DHC one has been recommended by a friend
1593473253.0,1,"Croatia, Europe."
1593546575.0,1,Lol that‚Äôs amazing. He should just flaunt what he‚Äôs got!
1593473770.0,1,I will do group review here...but it will take a while. I like Japanese lash serum better because they don't sting my eyes and I can see the strengthening part. Actually aside from the one by Kiss Me Heroine Make (they had one before) most have some effect when I use them on the bald patch of my eyebrow.
1593469877.0,8,"I bought some castor oil, pipets, and empty lip gloss containers from Lotion Crafters and filled the empty lip gloss containers with Castro oil and I use the wand to dab a teeny bit on my lashes at night.

1593535291.0,2,I use an old mascara wand. I apply at night.
1593464197.0,2,"No problemo, def keep it up! You'll notice if you stop. I add some vitamin E oil to mine too. Not sure if it makes a big difference, but I've read a few times that it's also good for lashes/brows."
1593469359.0,8,"I order empty mascara tubes on Amazon for super cheap and just fill them up with half castor oil and half E oil. Super easy application for lashes and brows!

edit: and I apply all over my lashes and brows like mascara, wiggling the brush back and forth to really coat all the hairs. Apply more towards the tips of your lashes if you don't want it to get in your eyes a bit. Doesn't hurt or anything but it's annoying if you're up and active. I usually slather it on right before bed so i don't have to worry about that. I apply it with a lighter hand during most days when I don't have makeup on."
1593469072.0,1,No op but I use a clean mascara wand

1593491653.0,40,Is this really medium tone?
1593470288.0,6,"After lusting at u/brownluvcony lovely swatches for the longest time, last week I bought a bunch of Romand lip products from Yesstyle. I placed order on June 20, shipped out June 22 and I received it June 28. I received free express shipping via Fedex, may be worth noting that all items in my order were shown as ""in stock, 1-2 days"".

My skintone is Armani LSF 5.5 but my arm is probably lighter than my face. Picture is taken in late morning with direct sun, the swatches from top to bottom:

* Glasting Water Tint in # 5 Rose Splash
* Glasting Water Tint in # 6 Purple Shower
* Glasting Water Tint in # 8 Rose Stream
* Juicy Lasting Tint in # 6 Figfig
* Zero Velvet Tint # 04 Burnt Heart
* Zero Layer Lipstick # M04 Fig Canon

I am a bit discouraged by the colors of Korean lip products. Colors that look muted on arms (even the most subdued one like Rose Stream or Apieu Water Tint RD03) appeared BRIGHT on my lips upon application, like it has a fuschia undertone or something. I wonder if this is done on purpose as I notice a lot of K-Pop stars often sports bright makeup. When I buy Korean lip stuff next time, I think I need to just go darker if I want muted MLBB-type of colors.

Formula Review:

**Glasting Water Tint** \-- thin non-sticky gloss with saturated color. These smell like soapy floral grape with awful fake sweetness, like Splenda-type, you know? Of all the lip products above, they have the strongest tint that stays even with oil makeup remover. Nice colors, just don't lick your lips :)

**Juicy Lasting Tint** \-- thin gloss with saturated color, slight stickiness. This one smells fruity (no soapy scent) and thank goodness, does not taste like anything. The smells reminds me of Apieu Water Tint and I wonder if the formula is actually dupe of each other. I wore this for an hour and my lips feels smoother because of the hydrating formula.

**Zero Velvet Tint** \- slightly mousse-y cream formula, has a lot of slip. Despite of having ""tint"" in the name, it does not seem to stain at all especially compared to Glasting Water Tint formula. There is a very, very slight non-offensive soapy scent. No taste, so all good!

**Zero Layer Lipstick** \- matte formula lipstick, more slip than Loreal Ultra Matte formula if you are familiar with it. No scent, no taste. All good too!

I had the most hope for Glasting Water Tint, but after I tried them all, my fave is Zero Velvet Tint formula. Thanks for reading!"
1593486257.0,3,I WANT THEM ALL
1593486850.0,3,I‚Äôm so flattered haha! I‚Äôm happy you like them especially the zero velvet tints which are a favorite of mine.

1593830147.0,2,I also love the Canmake sunscreen! The only thing is it's not shiny for me during summertime. But I love it during winter.
1593497036.0,2,I love CanMake too! It's the prefect texture and that's all I use since 2 years. I do have a combination skin and would need to blot nose and forehead. But it's well worth it for me

1593529775.0,3,I have pretty oily skin and this is my fave sunscreen! It‚Äôs not greasy or heavy but it definitely gives a glowy look and doesn‚Äôt mattify at all. So even if I‚Äôm not wearing foundation I usually use a little bit of translucent powder.

1593401878.0,55,"\[Review\] Innisfree Green Tea Seed Skin

Recently, I‚Äôve been trying new skincare products from my recent haul from Dodoskin ([dodoskin.com](http://dodoskin.com/)). I love being able to find my fave Korean brands, so there‚Äôs definitely going to be more hauls üí∏.

About this product:

* consists of green tea extract and seed oil that are full of antioxidants and have antibacterial properties that can help clear your skin
* there is fragrance + limonene + linalool - ingredients that can be sensitizing and irritating :(
* includes glycerin that replenishes moisture to your skin
* has citric acid for chemical exfoliation

Review: 

Innisfree‚Äôs Green Tea Seed Serum was my very first skincare product that I tried and loved, so I decided to try another product from the line: the toner. This toner is very watery and includes green tea leaf extract and seed oil that provide antioxidants and hydration to your skin. There‚Äôs also citric acid which is an AHA (good for chemical exfoliating) and glycerin that provides more hydration to your skin. This is super cooling and refreshing on my skin, so it definitely wakes me up in the morning. My biggest issue with this is: fragrance. Sadly, there‚Äôs not only fragrance, but also limonene & linalool. These two ingredients (plus fragrance) can be quite sensitizing, so it definitely can cause issues for those with sensitive skin. Personally, this wasn‚Äôt my favorite toner based on the ingredients. I‚Äôve used ones with better formulas, so I won‚Äôt be going back to this toner. 

How to use: 

After cleansing your skin, use a cotton pad and pour some toner onto it. Gently swipe it across your face, prepping your skin for absorbing other skincare products. Then, follow up with your normal skincare routine.

Skin recommendations: normal, dry"

For example, I tried the La Neige Cream Skin and found it to be too heavy for everyday, and I'm really finicky about the finish that a product leaves. I'll still use it occasionally for emergencies though, like after a clay mask that leaves my skin super parched. So I guess the green tea serum was just enough hydration for me!

1593497849.0,3,"Hi,

Looking for recommendations for an alternative product to the COSRX one step original clear pads. Mainly after a product that contains the natural BHA ingredient Betaine Salicylate, at a low %. 

I love the COSRX pads, however, I‚Äôm afraid of developing contact dermatitis due to the swiping motion of the product (though I do try to pat it gently into my skin most the time), as Liah Yoo mentioned in one of her videos that this happened to her (not sure if it was this specific product, but it was a pre-soaked pad type of product). 

I use the COSRX pads after I shower as a toner. 

I have normal skin, a bit oily on t zone. I used to have mild hormonal acne on my chin (one to a few would pop up during the month), until I used the COSRX pads and now my skin is at its best. 

I live in Australia and it‚Äôs currently winter here but seasons don‚Äôt affect my skin much (I use the same routine year round).

My routine as below:

AM: 
- wash face with warm water
- cerave PM moisturiser 
- Klairs soft airy UV sunscreen SPF50+

PM:
- heimish all clean balm
- cerave hydrating cleanser
- COSRX one step original pads 
- COSRX advanced snail mucin power essence
- Cerave PM moisturiser 

Any recommendations would be appreciated as these pads have kept my hormonal acne on my chin at bay but I don‚Äôt plan on using it on my skin forever if it might cause long term damage. 

PS. I am quite new to the active ingredients game, so any tips are also appreciated in this realm!"

I've been using something called Smooth E cream my aunt gave me while in Thailand, which is promoted to heal scars but wanted to see if there's anything else.

They aren‚Äôt turning into pimples per se, but my face has gotten blotchy and doesn‚Äôt feel perfectly smooth. I‚Äôve added the CosRx BHA pads (1 - 2x per week), the CosRx 96% Snail Mucin Essence and the CosRx AHA and BHA toner spray. I think the issue is I used the toner spray every night for a week not realising that it should only be used every second day. Also wondering if it could be my bumps coming to the surface because of the AHAs/BHAs. The texture isn‚Äôt enough for me to stop anything as of yet, but I am wondering about it. Nothing else has changed in my routine.

1593525299.0,1,"Hello! Looking for some recommendations for some ultra moisturizing, super hydrating products. Serums, essences, ampoules, moisturizers, anything!

my issue is I believe I‚Äôve messed up my skin barrier by overexfoliating at one point. It‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve cut back on any exfoliation and I‚Äôve been using products with ceramides, but nothing seems to be helping. It‚Äôs just my jaw line that is experiencing this dryness. No flakiness, just tightness. 

The rest of my skin is more on the normal side with an oily T-zone. My skin isn‚Äôt too sensitive or acne prone. I live on Northeastern US coast, so right now in the summer, it‚Äôs relatively humid. 

Here is my current routine, it‚Äôs pretty much the same for both AM and PM

1593517037.0,4,"contact dermatitis is usually cause by the product itself and not really from the swipping motion of pads.

I use the By Wishtrend Quod Active Boosting essence.  it is pretty weak but still check the ingredient list.  I used the cosrx pads in the past and it was alright but just expensive to keep on using daily."

1593535954.0,3,Haha the multiple benefits of masks! I‚Äôve used the Cosrx Snail 96 essence on cuts or picked pimples sometimes to see if it helps with scarring and in my experience it does.
1593536582.0,2,"Oh no! As someone who got into an accident that required stitches on my eyebrow, I feel your concern about the scar. Back then I didn‚Äôt use AB, and plain old broke open vitamin E gel capsules and smeared them on the scar for a while. The color goes away after a year or so, and after 5 years, I only notice the crescent outline. Good luck!"
1593552551.0,1,I like the jungsaemmool cushion. What do you mean by off? I actually find it quite hard to find a match in cushions because the shade ranges tend to be pretty limited.
1593536184.0,5,"It‚Äôs not the SPF! You‚Äôre using it fantastically, but besides exfoliation you may want to look into alternating between that and a product that lightens hyperpigmentation: vitamin C, alpha arbutin, lactic acid, snail mucin, retinol, etc. look up products in the sub and good luck!"
1593553411.0,4,"Speaking as someone who is prone to PIH, 2 months is not long enough in terms of fading it unfortunately, at least for me. I have some really stubborn spots that have taken nearly a year to disappear completely! I would keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and make sure to take progress pictures, because it‚Äôs likely fading already but it‚Äôs hard to tell small differences."
1593616392.0,2,"I had the same problem but on my cheek area. Had a collection of 3 or 4 spots that left reddish/ brown marks (is that PIH or PIE? Never could get it right...) 

Like you I was using a high spf and pa rated sunscreen, and Melano CC (it helps! But very gradually) but it was still there after 2-3 months (very noticeable when the rest of your face is clear!)

What really helped them to fade was when I incorporated an emulsion into my routine. The added hydration and moisture evened out the sallow areas of my face and made the spots fade out. And this was with toners/ moisturizers that I felt were sufficiently hydrating/ moisturizing for my skin. I notice that emulsions really add that thin layer of protection that helps everything come together nicely. Sleeping masks can also perform a similar function, but I prefer emulsions + moisturizer/ sleeping mask now that the weather is warmer and more humid."
1593519952.0,2,The AHA BHA toner spray is a pH lowering toner so my guess is that it is breaking you out. It should not cause any sort of purging because the amount of acids are incredibly minuscule at 0.1% AHA and 0.1% BHA. Ofc it could be the other products you introduced recently too...
1593528381.0,1,Aha  and bha is useful for diminishing texture actually. However the extremely low concentration of both aha bha in the toner and pad means that it is most likely other ingredients in the same product breaking you out.
1593519806.0,3,"It is fine to slowly work your way up to alternate days, then everyday if your skin can handle it. It's also fine if your skin is too sensitive to handle everyday. Just listen to your skin and adjust accordingly."
1593540455.0,2,If your skin barrier is the source of your problems I suggest trying to find ingredients that heal or soothe. I usually use aloe face masks when my skin barrier is compromised followed by other humectant heavy skin care. I personally like Holika Holika honey sleeping pack after a face masks to lock in hydration.
1593536427.0,1,"Hi! Currently on the west coast but lived on the east coast for five years. I love the hanskin hyaluron essence. Very buildable. The innisfree orchid cream is decent but not crazy amazing. The acwell licorice toner is watery but layering gives a nice, first step in hydration(think plumping); it also has an added bonus of helping  fade acne scars or pigmentation (but at a slower rate than actives). I‚Äôm testing out the enature birch juice hydrating sleeping mask for the last 2 weeks and am enjoying it so far!"
1593617213.0,1,"Aloe Vera gels are great for adding quick soothing hydration, but you would need to use a thicker occlusive to keep that hydration in if your skin still feels tight. 

When my moisture barrier was compromised, IOPE Derma Repair Cica Cream was amazing for helping to heal it. It's not too thick so perfect for summer, and it really made my skin feel softer than other thicker/richer creams. 

If you want to give it a try you can get samples of it from roseroseshop!"

1593560352.0,1,Yes. I consider our skin routine like brushing your teeth and going to the facialist like going to the dentist.
1593616758.0,1,"You could try chemical exfoliation. AHAs (glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic etc) work on the surface and BHAs (salicylic acid) work within the pores. Go slowly if you're just starting!! Once or twice a week, then move up to 2 or 3 times once you're used to it.  

Always make sure to sufficiently hydrate and moisturize if not you risk making it worse! Small bumps could mean dehydrated skin, so try to start with layers of thin hydrating toners and see if that helps."
1593554875.0,1,I use it every morning before moisturizer and SPF. I don't have sensitive skin and I can handle using it everyday without any irritations. Other people say that they experienced itching and stinging when they use it so it's best to patch test first.
1593552344.0,2,"In my experience, there are good deals at any given time. But you have to price compare with eBay.

I highly recommend getting a sunstick for reapplication (outdoors or indoors) cause you don't need to use your hands and it works mostly fine above makeup (I usually only use a thin layer of loose powder to tone down shine/ even out skin tone).

1593557442.0,1,"> It‚Äôs not the SPF! 

Yes, it very well could be. If there is very low protection in UVA1 it will not help much, if at all. PA++++ says nothing about UVA1 protection and the PA++++ formulations I've examined look to be very low in UVA1. This is why many of us insist on PPD 30 or higher which is generally heavier euro formulations.

Adding regular exfoliation will help speed up the process, i.e. a glycolic at 8-10% and pH 3.5 or below."

Thanks for your advice - definitely ensuring that! I'm using a mix of Body Shop Drop of Youth products (trying to finish my supply) and Cosrx Galactomyces 95 and Rice Overnight Spa Mask. My face is very thirsty!

1593536691.0,3,It could just be that the product itself is not strong enough for you or the right product!
1593648007.0,1,"In my case it did! 

I think sufficiently moisturizing your skin helps it to heal and turnover over by itself. And I know it's difficult to find a light enough moisturizer for humid weather, hence the emulsion recommendation. 

Also a retinol really speeds up the turnover process, so I'd suggest getting one if you weren't already using it. Look for one with an airless pump if it's a cream, or with a dropper if it's in oil (like TO retinol 0.5%)"
1593566819.0,1,"I apply 2-3 drops on the whole face. Yeah, it does! I have reddish acne in my cheeks before I used it and after few days, the acne flattened and the scar is barely visible now :) I love this serum!"
1593632607.0,2,"Well ingredients wise it‚Äôs kind of similar, but that‚Äôs as close as they get. The Ampoule is incredibly thick, and instead of being used around the serum step they recommend you use it after moisturizer as an occlusive. It‚Äôs like a gel and it forms this protective layer on your skin once it dries, but it doesn‚Äôt stay sticky like when first applied"
1593575014.0,1,"I‚Äôve been on accutane twice and I‚Äôll say that neither are going to be hydrating and moisturizing enough for the dryness that your lips will experience while on accutane. It‚Äôs not ab or cutesy like lip masks, but a huge tube of good old Aqupaphor or CeraVe Healing Oitment will be your best friend for your lips and are way more effective as lip masks.

However, I highly recommend also getting a few tubes of a lip balm called Dr. Dans Cortibalm. It was created specifically for accutane patients experiencing extremely dry, chapped lips. It has 1% hydrocortisone to help help heal the inflammation and chapped skin on your lips. It‚Äôs only available online as far as I know, and it‚Äôs a little pricey, but it was definitely a lifesaver and well worth the price. During my first course, I only used aquaphor which relieved my chapped lips temporarily during the day. But when I started my second course, I discovered cortibalm which saved and actually healed my lips, so I ended up only using this all the time. Regardless, I still do recommend both, cortibalm to help heal and aquphor as an occlusive for your lips. I still use cortibalm even after accutane, honestly the best lip balm I‚Äôve ever used. 

Taking a look at the rest of your routine, I honestly would not overload it with too many products, especially if you have sensitive skin. All you truly need is a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, and then maybe a hydrating layer. In my opinion after going through this twice, focusing solely on Ab products was not the best when it came down to building an accutane routine. Western products were much more effective, especially when it came down to moisturizing, while AB products, like hydrating toners or essences, did help to soothe and alleviate some of the dehydration. So my recs aren‚Äôt really going to be AB sorry

For a cleanser, I recommend a gentle creamy cleanser. La Roche Posay Ultra Hydrating Cleanser is what I used for my courses. I initially used Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, but it made my skin tingle for some reason, so I stopped using it. Obviously YMMV but I do think the LRP is the better option for the size alone, it comes in a gigantic 430ml bottle that will last you months. It‚Äôs very gentle, soothing and hydrating like the name implies. I love the cosrx cleanser, but it‚Äôs not the best option while on accutane because it‚Äôll be too drying for your skin.

Moisturizer, you‚Äôve probably heard this a million times, but I recommend simply CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion or Cream. I don‚Äôt like the texture of the cream, I used the lotion 
during my courses because it absorbs faster and didn‚Äôt  leave my skin feeling stuffy. Some people use both, it depends on how severe your dryness is. You‚Äôll be going through a ton of moisturizer while on accutane, which is why I‚Äôd recommend something that‚Äôs easy to buy here and affordable. I have heard illyoon was nice, though I can‚Äôt speak on it personally so I have no idea if it will be moisturizing enough for accutane skin. The Cosrx lotion will definitely not be moisturizing enough.

I‚Äôd personally hold off with all the extras, like the essence and oils, until after you start your course. Within the first couple of weeks, or even days, you‚Äôll experience first hand how drastically your skin will change, and from there on you can adjust accordingly. I did use the HL premium, which was great for hydration, so that‚Äôs something that you can use for a hydrating layer.

Hope this helped, feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. /r/Accutane  is also a good source of information/discussion too."

1593690396.0,1,"In terms of Light moisturisers, I use the Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid lotion. I have the normal, LIGHT, and Premium version. In humid weather, is the LIGHT version better or the thicker and Premium version?

And yes I already am using TO retinol 0.5 in squalene EVERY 3 days at night. Though after adding it I always feel as if it isn't absorbing enough (I use 4 drops btw)? My face is relatively oily and sometimes I wait for 10 minutes before adding my moisturiser. Any tips?"
1593635835.0,2,Oooh sounds like exactly what I‚Äôm looking for! I already use the toner and love it. Thanks so much!!
1593732005.0,1,"I believe for most japanese products lotion means toner, and milk means emulsion. I can't say which is better, but go with the one that works best/ absorbs most easily with your skin. 

It's great you're already using a retinol! Squalane can feel a little heavy on the skin, especially in humid weather. I've found that mixing the oil directly with moisturizer helps to cut down on the greasy feeling. And if your skin can tolerate the retinol every 3 nights, it may be worth working your way up to applying every night to really speed up the turnover."
1593635896.0,2,"I use the toner and love it too, hope you like it if you do try it out!"
1593791633.0,1,Ok ty !
1593529242.0,7,"Sorry this is a bit long, but I'm really excited because it's my first ever skincare [haul](https://imgur.com/a/78fDxAp)! And it's from PinkNBlossom. I highly recommend this retailer, fast shipping from Canada and they also have a huge sale right now. This comes out to about $110 for price reference, which makes each product about $11 (the small size stuff/mask + sample are free gifts), which I think, is quite a good deal!  

Before this, I've had a simple routine of about 2 years (before that I mostly just splash my face with water....), consisting of cleanser and mostly Hada Labo lotion + milk. They do work to hydrate, but recently, I have felt they either stopped working, or my skin just doesn't like hyaluronic acid *as much*. It's still one of those products that are very gentle and doesn't cause any irritation on my skin though, so I probably will still keep them around.  

About 2 months ago, I also bought (non-AB) Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel-cream and Rosehip seed oil. The Neutrogena moisturizer is okay, but doesn't seem like it's doing much while I do really like the Rosehip oil, it seems to calm my redness.   

I've been reading a lot recently about Asian skin care, particular those with propolis/bee pollen extract, so I wanted to get those (the  Missha bee pollen renew kit as introductory kit to the line, and Cosrx propolis light ampoule). 

I also wanted to get some toners/asian lotion that is not Hada Labo, i.e. has more than just HA, so I got the Soon Jung Relief toner, Pyunkang Yul Essence toner (just tried this out twice, and been liking it so far), and out of curiosity, the Missha Super Aqua Snail essence. Unfortunately PnB doesn't list all the product's ingredients so I didn't realize this one has fragrance quite high on the list, probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise. If anyone has tried this, I'm curious about your opinion!  

Most excited about the Mizon Black AIO snail cream. Been hearing a lot about snail, and I hope to replace this snail cream for the Neutrogena Hydroboost. And maybe if I need some extra hydration, or when my skin just likes gentle moisturizer, I'll end the routine with Soon Jung 2x Intensive Barrier cream.  

This was definitely a lot of products; it's really my first time spending so much on skin care, and I most likely won't use all at once, but I wanted to splurge a little in this quarantine, and try out a few products that I've been hearing a lot.  

Hopefully in a few months when I've tried most of them, I can write something up! :)"

1593545827.0,2,"How do you like the IUNIK Centella Calming Gel Cream? I have one IUNIK product (the beta-glucan serum) and love it.  


Here's my routine (dry, acne/clog-prone, medium/dark skin - I'm South Indian). I'm focused on hydrating, healing + fading PIH from picking. I get PIH easily and before AB it was much more stubborn to fade. These are products which have been gentle on my compromised skin and have also noticeably sped up healing - both in terms of open wounds and PIH:

  
**HG**  
**Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 Relief Toner** (a favorite on this sub. Noticeably soothing & I feel like it helps my other products penetrate better)  
**Melano CC** (this stuff works so well for my PIH)  
**IUNIK Beta-Glucan Power Moisture Serum** (game changer for me in terms of adding hydration, I also read that beta-glucan stimulates collagen production)  
**CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** (snail is one of my healing holy grails! this for me is not hydrating enough on its own but good after the IUNIK serum or mixed with a some aloe vera gel. Seriously helps my acne + picked spots heal much faster)  
**Rosehip seed oil** (night only) - I use a small amount and only put this on my cheeks + PIH. Apparently acneic skin can be lacking in linoleic acid which this then supplies. Rosehip has really been helping with my PIH and it feels sooooo nice on my skin. I did noticed little CCs on my chin when I used it there after a few nights, but I just stopped using it there and it's been fine. I recommend trying it out but starting slow - just use it to spot treat at first maybe? As an oil/occlusive it would go at the end of your routine

**Also great but started using recently:**  
Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel - I had been looking for a light preferably gel moisturizer to go over the serum + snail, but I find most moisturizers too heavy  (weirdly even though I have dry skin), this has a really nice texture and doesn't break me out, plus additional humectants  + wound healing from the HA. I seriously have tried so many moisturizers that my skin hates, RIP wallet. Love this so far, will RP.  
Isntree Green Tea Moist Emulsion - Antioxidants and sebum controlling properties but gentle, one of the few things I can use on my nose which gets SF's easily. Also got salix alba (willow) bark extract a goodie for acne as it mildly exfoliates and reduces inflammation. Expires 6mo after opening product though (I think?) and idk if I'll use it all up. Likely RP.  


**SPF** \-  I'm honestly still searching and always on the lookout (anybody who got one pls hit me) but rn my fav is the Purito Centella Unscented. I tried it once previously and thought maybe it broke me out (I'm paranoid about sunblocks + clogs in general) but have since gone back and .. oh my god. It's almost everything I dreamed of. Beautiful texture, alcohol-free, HYDRATING, madecassoside + centella for healing, dewy (but not too dewy) finish, brightening, sign me right up! I say ALMOST because it's not something I would be comfortable wearing in a situation where I was spending a lot of time directly in the sun or like doing outdoor activities in the summer - it's not water resistant and more of an everyday sunscreen. I put it on as my protection when I'm around the house and when I walk the dog (after 4pm). 

Before this I was using LRP Shaka fluid everyday which has higher protection and great texture but the alcohol in it was really drying for my skin in a way I honestly didn't even realize until I switched...it never broke me out at least. I wish they would reformulate without the alcohol :(  I get sketched out too cause so many US sunscreens (and some AB ones!) use chemical filters that have been linked to endocrine (hormone) disruption and have been shown to penetrate the skin and linger in the bloodstream. I'm not a scientist so literally what do I know really, but the long term possible cumulative effects worry me and keep me obsessively researching sunscreens.

My HG spot treatment for active spots/acne - **Etude House AC Clean Up Pink Powder Spot**. Salicyclic acid on its own has never been particularly effective on my spots, I think the sulfur helps by soothing while allowing the salicyclic acid to do its job?  


I also love using sheet masks - in particular snail sheet masks :) 

If you like your Vit C great, if not I recommend trying Melano CC! It's gentle, lasts ages and one of the most stable formulations out there. I was also gonna recommend niacinamide but see you have that already! There's also acids for resurfacing/pigmentation obviously but rn I don't have any in my routine, I'll let others who use those recommend :) 

Overall: I feel like (for my skin) making it the gentlest and most hydrating routine possible has really helped me. Also crucial has been not picking at my skin and listening to my skin when I apply new products - I'm bad about patch testing but I have at least gotten more in tune to my skin and have weeded out products that I previously thought were helping. It's hard to sift through all the marketing bullshit out there, and then even when it's sincerely not bullshit, skincare is such a YMMV, am I right? 

I know from experience how annoying and discouraging it can be, sending some positivity :)"
1593537305.0,1,"I LOVE the Melano CC Vitamin C Serum - a few drops covers my whole face, neck, and backs of my hands. I feel like it's given me brighter skin, and any blemish marks fade really quickly.

For about 6-7 months now, I've been using TO Niacinamide Serum and believe that is helping with any hyperpigmentation. I know this product tends to be kind of polarizing, and some folks have had bad experiences with this. I have fairly sensitive skin, and I've been loving this. It's a strong concentration, so I apply with some CosRx Snail Mucin Essence.

On that note: I'm a sucker for snail products, and feel that they help nourish and heal my skin. Like many ABers, I love the Mizon Cream Gel, but also rotate in the Secret Key Snail Repairing Essence. Got a bug bite? BOOM! Snail cream! The itch disappears and any redness is gone."
1593539562.0,1,"Vitamin C should help with dark spots & brightening - the timeless you mentioned would be great. An AB option is the melano cc which works quite well and is very gentle (in my experience).

You may also have some luck by rotating your PC BHA with an AHA which can help with superficial scars/marks. A good AB option is the krave kale-lalu-yAHA

1593367038.0,25,"3CE TAKE A LAYER MULTIPOT IN CABBAGE ROSE

Ingredient list https://www.skincarisma.com/products/3ce/take-a-layer-multi-pot/ingredient_list

*I have combination acne-prone skin. My T-zone and chin can get really oily, while my cheeks lean more on the drier side.

DESCRIPTION: An airy matte collection that can be blended freely, and gives a comfortable finish to the lips and cheeks as if nothing is applied. With a creamy sliding texture that melts onto skin for long-lasting color.

APPLICATION: I applied it on my eyes and lips with my fingers and used a damp beauty blender for my cheeks and found it easy to apply. It does not set very quickly, leaving room and time to blend. It sets on the skin beautifully and looks really natural.

FORMULA: Quite pigmented! I feel like it's gonna take a long time before I pan this. It has a creamy powder texture and a finish that's matte but not cakey or dry. If you do use this on the lips, I recommend using a lip balm beforehand.

COLOR & LONGEVITY: Cabbage Rose is described as an ""understated deep rose hue"". Imo, it's a rosy coral shade with peach tones. This shade is one of the bestsellers in this range, but tbh I find the color to be basic. It's beautiful but not special, which makes it perfect for a ""My lips/cheeks but better"" look. On my cheeks and my eyes, it lasted for about 10 hours (lessened in pigment around the 6 hour mark). I wore a mask in between and it didn't budge or create any weird lines. As for my lips, maybe around 4 hours (without eating or drinking)."
1593403877.0,6,"thank you for the review! i've been interested in these for so long (and in a lot of different shades) but given the price and current shipping lags from skorea, i've been holding off on buying them (plus i have so many cream blushes already lol). cabbage rose was one of the top shades i was considering so knowing that it's basic, i can perhaps take it off my list üòÇ were there other shades that you were interested in as well? also, would you say the finish (on cheeks) is matte no matter the base makeup? i like to use cream blush on bare skin, and usually my skin is anywhere between tacky and greasy (depending on the sunscreen i use), so it might be weird if i have a matte blush circle on top of that

thanks in advance! and you look so great in the photo! üòä"
1593406399.0,3,"can you describe in great detail for application on your cheeks? do you take the product and dot it on your cheeks then blend or? 
also where do you put the product & spread it? (high points on cheekbones to front cheeks? temples?) 
how much of the product do you use for your cheeks, eyes and lips?

ty for the review! i bought this shade and had it for quite a while but never reached for it. we‚Äôre similar in facial features and skin tone so i‚Äôm excited to try it again üòä"
1593416078.0,3,I have a multi pot in Diotima and I really like it as a blush or under  lipbalm. My eyelids are so oily that the multi pot on it's own doesn't last but I haven't tried it over an eye primer yet.

1593555775.0,1,I love their Diotima and Holly Hock! üòç
1593404917.0,6,"Not OP but I wear this in 2 other shades (primula, common time) on days I wear makeup. They are a natural finish on skin with no base makeup, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super matte, which I prefer."
1593409496.0,1,"It's more of a natural sheer matte. I actually only have a bit concealer on my cheeks and undereye and didn't use any powder to set my face. My skincare makes me greasy as well (I like to layer my toners and moisturizersss), but I found this product played well into that, making my cheeks less oily looking and just ""dewy"". 

I'm thinking of picking up Diotima as well, but I'm thinking of trying out other cream blushes from different brands since I just started using them after thinking for so long it will only disrupt my base makeup because of the formula. Do you have any favourites from your collection? üòä"
1593408361.0,7,"I dab a clean damp beauty blender directly on the pan and then dab it on my cheeks! Even though it's quite pigmented, the wet sponge doesn't pick up a lot of the cream product so it makes it buildable and easy to spread. I usually start applying blush from the high points of my cheekbones then to the front of my cheeks. I found focusing it on the apples of my cheeks drags my face down. 

The product is very buildable and pigmented, so it doesn't really take that much. I don't like to go full opaque with my lip products so just one finger swipe for my lips is enough and I just feather it out. I use even less product for my eyes, like maybe one pinky finger swipe for both of my eyes' upper lid and lower lash line.

Excited for you! I hope you have fun with it! :)"
1593407786.0,3,"thank you! that‚Äôs great to know ‚Äî i would prefer the natural finish for both bare skin days and makeup days (i go for dewy finishes with my makeup)

1593798171.0,1,"sorry for the late reply, but yes, i can share some of my favorites!

so my top cream/liquid blushes are actually non-ab ones (such as the the kosas color + light, daniel sandler watercolor blush, em cosmetics serum blush), but some ab ones i've tried and liked are the NAMING playful creme blush and the CLIO pro tinted veil blusher. both of these have slightly dewy finishes, with the CLIO being a bit more sheer. a few others i've tried that have more of a matte finish (almost powdery-cream) the Peripera pure blushed velvet cheek and the Tonymoly Cheektone Cream"
1593408519.0,1,"I‚Äôm about a light medium and neutral undertone with naturally red cheeks, usually 25 in Asian shades. The orange on me looks more coral when I don‚Äôt have base makeup, not necessarily bad. I think it‚Äôs the only flattering orange I‚Äôve ever found in my life. My friend is more fair skin and olive toned and it looks really nice on her too, it almost doubled as a bronzer because it looks like she‚Äôs been in the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è"
1593409522.0,1,"thanks! it's hard to find reviews/swatches for common time (esp compared to other shades like diotima and cabbage rose), so that's v helpful! i like coral shades, orange is a bit intimidating for me, but i'll keep this shade in consideration üòä"

I use the Super Moisture Milk (gold bottle) if I need waterproof, even works on my face.  If I don't, I use the Super Moisture Essence on my face and the Super Moisture Gel on my body.

They're based out of CA I believe and have pretty fast shipping in the states. They carry a lot of HG favorites like Melano CC, Naturie, Hada Labo, Biore and Skin Aqua sunscreens etc., though their makeup selection is lacking apart from Canmake items, which they have a ridiculous amount of--they're Canmake's official retailer in the U.S.. Prices are reasonable, especially if you're looking for Canmake stuff and are concerned about counterfeits. I just did a huge Canmake haul from them and everything was packaged so nicely, none of the blushes and eyeshadows I brought were damaged. 

I also highly recommend Flowfushi's eyeliner, it's my HG liquid liner. The precision of the brush tip is insane. They rebranded as UZ in the U.S., and have a website you can order directly from. Canmake's pencil eyeliner is also pretty good, but the twist function is effed in that you can't make the product go back into the pencil. 

I also have raved about this before in the community, but Cure Aqua Gel is also fantastic. It's a gommage peeling gel, and takes everything off really well. It's one of my favorite exfoliating products."

The sunblock I mentioned just changed formulation, so my criteria for those was a pic of the actual sunblock and not a stock pic, to make sure I was getting the new stuff and not the old stock.  Or if the ad specified ""new formulation"" that might sub for the actual pic.  

One thing to note right now is that I think Japan post is either still shut down or really restricting mail.  Normally a million people have this stuff.

Last year I suddenly started breaking out on my cheeks and my forehead and my neck. I felt so down and lost a lot of confidence. 

Now my skin is smooth, and pretty clear again. The biggest thing that has made me happy was feeling how smooth my skin is whenever I wash it compared to when I used to have acne.

When my skin's only texture is ""baby like"". Sadly due to years of self-abuse, I have destroyed any semblance of small pores on my t-zone and I live with the consequences. I may always look like I have freckles but as long as it's flat (where I might cover with makeup or just at least feel the smoothness), I'm fine. If my skin is dewy in the mornings, that's a bonus.

Of course it took me years to get here. Back in the day, my goal was to have no zits. Nowadays I think my goal is to soften my hyperpigmentation (which of course comes at random in the form of a massive painful harbinger zit which I refuse to manhandle) and ""empty"" my SFs on my T zone/clear out some gunk in there.

Something I found helpful in my own self image was actually looking far more into the tips and tricks the people use to edit videos and pictures to make their skin look better than to actually look at the finished images. After spending some years now consuming more content about the process than the end result, I can confidently walk down a street any day and know that if I see people with better skin than me they either have makeup on, can afford treatments I can‚Äôt, or there‚Äôs just a genetic factor involved that I can do nothing to change and so why bother thinking about. I think mostly you have to learn how to minimise the amount that you compare yourself to others physically because it only leads to unhappiness and insecurity or thinking/talking badly about others purely due to looks - focus more on the journey of doing what‚Äôs healthy for your skin and coming to first accept, then love the skin you have and making it work for you."

For the longest time, I hated the texture on my cheeks because I would see celebrities with *super* smooth skin with literally no pores. I tried everything to achieve that poreless look, but I now realize that celebrities get all these expensive treatments done, plus there's almost always some type of makeup, editing, lighting, etc. at play.

I mostly struggle with dry skin and just use some gentle soap and moisturizer. Pimples will be there depending on where I am in my cycle, but it becomes a problem when they appear for an extended period of time, especially on a certain place on my face because it means one of my new products is causing me to have break-outs. Recently, it's been my new flavor of toothpaste that caused breakouts on my chin.

I think oiliness and even a little redness is fine as well as small pimples. But when it becomes painful and your pimples are developing a lot of pus and bleeding a lot and your face is flaking as well and it's red and itchy a lot of the time, you really need to get that checked on. I had allergies to my meds once and it did ALL of that. 

What a perfect skin is what is comfortable for you. I need to moisturize my skin, so I don't get itchy because that is hella uncomfortable for me. I don't get pimples that often because of genetics unless I'm at that point in my cycle, but if I do get pimples, I can just cover them with makeup.

I realise I will never have perfect skin because of genetics but I am satisfied that it‚Äôs healthy: not dry with minimal closed comedones and under the skin pimples. With time, my scarring has gotten lighter - up close you can see some pores from picking or deep pimples.

1593412164.0,1,"For me it‚Äôs just keeping my skin clean. I have a medium oily type of skin and when I was a teenager I didn‚Äôt take good care of myself, even with the things I usually ate or didn‚Äôt ate.

I wash my face with warm water (more cold than warm... I don‚Äôt know how to explain it) in the morning and put on my face cream. 

Normally I wash my face again at night.

Also once two weeks or so I like to rub an ice cube on my face when I wash my face at night.

Important thing I don‚Äôt do, I don‚Äôt dry my skin with any kind of cloth, I just dry the little drops on my neck and that‚Äôs it; when it‚Äôs almost dry I put on my face cream and I‚Äôm all ready. But this is a personal thing, I guess.

I don‚Äôt care getting pimples because at least once a month they come to visit, so I welcome them and go ahead with my life.

Another thing it‚Äôs that I love make up but I almost don‚Äôt wear any, on a daily basis I only do my eye shadow and eyebrows and wear sunblock. If I have a special ocasi√≥n I do my makeup fully.

And drinking water it‚Äôs a must and normal advice. But I guess that in conclusion, getting to know your own skin it‚Äôs the key. What kind of face mask work for you, what kind of pimples you get and where, and that it doesn‚Äôt get dry.

Your skin it‚Äôs your perfect skin, of course you need to take care of her. When you notice something out of the normal, (because hormones can get wild) then take note and if it something current reach for help.

I hope this kinda helped, and that you are good, happy and healthy"

Side notes:

Getting up close to your face, or anyone's face for that matter, will reveal countless imperfections. For me, that encourages picking, and it's unhealthy both mentally and for my skin.

Even if you do get very close to a friend's face, I think we are likely to be more forgiving about their skin vs our own. You may see very similar imperfections on someone else but judge yourself more harshly. We are our own worst critic - I think evaluating ourselves with kindness is very important."

I mean, it's not good to only look at the little flaws and imperfect points of your skin because ""perfect"" doesn't really exist. But I don't see a problem getting up close so I can adjust my skin routine to follow my skins problems. Like even if my friends don't see dry skin on my face, I can feel it is dryer than it was last week and can adjust my routine to add more hyraluronic acids and masks. 

This is a tough question since it sounds like a state of mind. If the little imperfections really bug you to the point that it hurts your self esteem, lean back a bit. But it's tough if you already have the mindset that your skin is ""bad"". I would say practice some positive enforcement. Some texture, dry areas, breakouts don't particularly mean bad skin. Everytime you lean in and see an imperfections, counter it with a positive. ""oh, there's some discoloration/redness here, BUT my skin is more moisturized this week from last week!"""

I just ordered from YESSTYLE and received a confirmation list of what I ordered.

Yet when I check my order history on their site, they replaced 4x of the five pack (item A) with SINGLE packs (item B).


What I ordered (even email confirmation says this):

1. 5x item A (5PCS in each)


What it says in order history:

1. 1x item A (5PCS in each)

2. 5x item B (1PC in each) same product but only piece in each. I NEVER ORDERED THIS ONE.

I sent them a message detailing the catalog numbers and everything relevant.

Now I'm worried I'm gonna be shipped incorrect items and charged full price close to $100.


Questions:

1. How does this happen? 
2. Where did ITEM B even come from when it was never in the order?
3. Item A is still listed as available on their website, so stock shouldn't be an issue?

comparing the ingredients on the ulta website/on my moisturizer box/the brand site (the brand website has the same ingredients as ulta, except ulta misspells Trisiloxane) vs on [ratzilla](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/curel-intensive-moisture-cream/), here's what i notice:

* allantoin is listed separately as an ""active ingredient"" on ratzilla (and on [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/curel-intensive-moisture-cream)), whereas on ulta (and on the brand site) it's listed as part of the ingredients list. i see on yesstyle that allantoin is the first ingredient, but i would guess the person who wrote the ingredients on there might have just copy and pasted it
* the order of ingredients after PEG-3 Dimethicone are different on the ulta site vs on ratzilla. imo if there's only 0.5% allantoin, i would imagine it's not a big deal and may just have to do with regulations on how ingredients under 1% are listed

that being said, i've never ordered the moisturizer off of yesstyle of amazin japan or anything so i can't say for sure if they're different or the same. i do think the moisturizer i purchased from ulta works very well. and really, what i'm interested in are the pseudoceramides (Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide), and that's the 3rd ingredient on all the listings"

For her skincare routine, we both use a rejuvenating set for about 2 months. It really whitened our skin and we didn't get pimples but I think it's too harsh. Our face is really white so we stopped it. So as of today, her skincare routine is just a soap, safeguard soap specifically.

It could be the weather although I believe the climate there is still a bit humid right? So it wouldn‚Äôt affect much. Maybe your skin needs a bit more moisture and then you could try to add the HA so it doesn‚Äôt burn or make your skin itch."

20% is pretty strong though, so start with every 2 days and see how you go."
1593470886.0,2,"I think a good starting place would be a gentle cleanser, an oil free hydrating moisturizer, and SPF during the day. I cant really tell from the picture since it's just of her forehead. If her face is so dry that it is flaky I would focus of keeping the skin hydrated. A lot of time skin that is lacking moisture will produce more oil in order to keep itself hydrated. This could be why her skin feels oily.

It's possible that they can't make a stable sunscreen formula if they need to add 5% or 10% niacinamide into the formulation. If you're already using a well formulated Niacinamide serum, that would be enough.


Innisfree Triple Care Sunscreen contains Niacinamide."

EltaMD has 5% niacinamide, which is pretty decent concentration, LRP has lower concentration I think (don't quote me), so you might want to try them if you like.  

I'm not aware of any AB sunscreen that has niacinamide, but others feel free to correct me.   

Agree with the other user that if you should look for separate products though!   

Good luck!"

1593442787.0,13,"I live in a dry climate (Canada) and find that pure hyaluronic based serums/hydrators, including the hada labo moist, don't really work for my already dry skin since there's just not enough moisture in the air on most days. This is a relatively common experience for people living in dry climates when using HA, so if this applies to you it may be that HA alone is not the best humectant for you.

Also, as another user pointed out, the hada labo is meant to be followed up by a moisturizer. If you're putting it on as the last step or not sealing it with a moisturizer, then the water will evaporate & leave you feeling dry. The best way (imo) to use the hada labo lotion & other humectants is to apply onto a damp face and seal it in with a moisturizer to prevent water loss from the skin."

So far I've personally ordered from Notino.si and Lookfantastic with free shipping. Feelunique also has some korean items on their website as well. They do all have a korean beauty section (that is kinda hidden sometimes, you just have to type some variation of ""korean skincare"" or ""korejska kozmetika""). I've also bought from skintrick.si before, not during these times however.

I've also considered iherb, an american website, where the shipping isn't that expensive. However, you do have to be careful with getting hit with an extra customs fee for orders over 22‚Ç¨ (i think).

For price tho? I cant fault it, i think its one of the best pot type concealers in that price range. Also the fact that u get 3 shades helps a lot in making the concealer look more natural with mixing.

1593405389.0,10,"For me it's more about taking things out of my routine. I've been avoiding putting retinol or benzoyl peroxide in the ""mask area"" since it makes the irritation worse, and I'm not wearing makeup. I'm being very careful about how much I exfoliate. Most spot treatments are drying, which is *not* what my extra-irritated rosacea wants rn, so I try to use it sparingly. 

I have been more diligent about applying moisturizer/aloe to (attempt) to form a barrier between my skin and the mask. Once my face gets sweaty under the mask, I'll wipe my skin gently with an antibacterial wipe, then switch out the previous mask for a fresh one. So I end up going through ~3 cotton masks on a full day and handwash them with fragrance free detergent every night. 

I've also stated putting hydrocolloid patches on particularly bad/irritated areas to have a physical barrier between my skin and the mask. Normally I don't wear patches during the day, but no one sees under the mask anyway so~"

1593442357.0,7,"I haven't personally tried wishtrend's vitamin C but it looks promising based on ingredients!

However, some recs for large pores & textured skin include:

* **Krave kale-lalu-yAHA** (has 5.25% glycolic acid & betaine salicylate which are exfoliating ingredients that help with pores, texture & breakouts. Other good exfoliating recs include Paula's choice 2% BHA liquid & stratia soft touch AHA)
* **Niacinamide** (helps with pores & sebum-regulation, skin-barrier maintenance, redness, breakouts - the ordinary, the inkey list, paula's choice, & 2sol all have 10% niacinamide serums. Niacinamide is also a popular ingredient in moisturizers: Purito deep sea water cream & cosrx rice overnight spa mask both have 2% niacinamide.
* **Green tea/Matcha/EGCG** (can help reduce the appearance of pores. Some suggestions: krave beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser, krave beauty beet the sun/the beet shield, peach & lily matcha pudding antioxidant cream, the etude house soon jung line is all formulated with green tea extract & are targeted towards sensitive, acne prone skin - also there are tons of ab green tea based toners & serums)
* **Hydration** (in my personal experience, I have the most texture when my skin is dehydrated so keeping skin hydrated & not dried out may also help with texture)"
1593469407.0,1,"I have tried out wishtrend 21.5 vitamin c sheet masks. And they are pretty good. The vitamin c here is naturally derived and even though I have very very sensitive skin, it didn't irritate me at all. 
The klairs vitamin c on the other hand broke me out terribly and made me dry out too.
Wishtrend vitamin c serum is very high in ascorbic acid containing 21.5%. be careful of vitamin c with this high percentage cause it's very potent. I have seen reviews about people saying that it caused tingling and burning sensation a lot. So haven't tried it out yet. If it fails, you can try out 'purito vitamin c serum', it contains 10% ascorbic acid which is quite decent too for a vitamin c serum. Hope this helps.
 So good luck to you!"
1593476737.0,1,It has been my absolute favorite. I like it better than the SkinCeuticals and it's a fraction of the price. A few weeks after I started using it people started commenting on how healthy my skin looked.
1593516008.0,1,"i like it and find it exactly the same as the TImeless vitamin C which i also like. however, i can't use it everyday else it will make my face goes red.  i use it once every 3days."
1593697768.0,1,"yes butttt, i remember the formula from a long time ago and it was much better. At that time I was using the serum and the sheet masks every single day and i was able to tell a significant. i mean significant difference. in 2019, i ordered them again, twice. the serum and the sheet masks. im pretty sure the formula and the packaging changed for both as well. for some reason i wasn't noticing the same results like i had back then. For the mask, the actual type of sheet changed as well.Im sure it's still good, but okay level? not as great as it used to be. My serums have expired but now im stuck with like 20+ vit c sheets i got when it was on BOGOF. i'll probably gift them."
1593809167.0,1,"Wishtrend's Pure Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum was actually the second vitamin C serum that I got my hands on when I first got deeply into skincare. I have oily and acne-prone skin, so I primarily wanted the Vitamin C serum to reduce my acne hyperpigmentation. For me, it worked really well for that (I used three drops - forehead and both cheeks - twice a day) since it's quite concentrated. I would recommend the Wishtrend's vitamin C serum for reducing hyperpigmentation.

That being said, if your skin is a bit sensitive, try looking into Wishtrend's **Pure Vitamin C 15% with Ferulic Acid** which is less concentrated than the Pure Vitamin C 21.5% serum. Good luck!

As a side note, I've also used the Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop and it was definitely much slower to give me the results I wanted because of the lower concentration (from what I could tell)."

1593456345.0,5,"Trouble is, there's a million causes for dark circles so there's no miracle cream that addresses all of them. Blood pooling, hyperpigmentation, poor circulation, sinus issues, poor sleep, poor hydration, thin skin, autoimmune or thyroid conditions, fat prolapse (eg festoons) due to weak muscles, or even just the way your skull is shaped.


I've had dark circles since I was a young child, I think I've got concave tear trough deformity with my orbital socket. Yeah sleeping poorly makes it worse, but amazing sleep and hydration doesn't get rid of them. Just under the threshold for hyperthyroidism, but not clinically significant. Caffeine serums don't help, moisturizers don't help. Getting enough sun every day (at least, not spending all day staring at a screen) seems to improve them marginally. But they'll never go away in my case.



Give caffeine serums a try, they work for SOME people; Dr Jart and The Ordinary have some. If one doesn't work, don't bother with any other caffeine stuff."

that said, the under eye area is tricky and there's a number of different factors that can create the appearance of dark circles so perhaps worth trying if you have it on hand. one of my HG products for the rest of the face though, i absolutely love it üòä"

1593326132.0,5,klairs unscented toner!! is fungal acne safe and leaves your skin feeling much hydrated.
1593326468.0,5,The I'm from rice toner would be perfect for you! It doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky and is great for fading hyperpigmentation
1593327028.0,6,"My skin's pretty similar and I'm currently loving the Kikumasamune High Moist, with an added layer of Mamonde Rose Water if I need the extra hydration. If it's only the BHA you don't like, though, the COSRX AHA is my failsafe when I'm breaking out even though the BHA was pretty awful for me.

And if you'd like to incorporate propolis into your routine like someone else suggested, the Skin Food Propolis Essence was pretty great for the first two bottles, though it sort of stopped working overnight for me and I don't know if my skin just got used to it or what. But it helped regulate oil production and left my skin neither matte nor greasy but just sort of glowy and bright, I miss it."
1593320288.0,3,"I say any hado labor lotion, as well as the licorice ph balancing toner (from soko glam's website, forget the brand!)"

It‚Äôll tell you if the product is fungal acne (malassezia) safe, and it‚Äôll also give you info on the ingredients and if they‚Äôre good for brightening and oily skin. This website has been a total game changer for me in deciding on purchases and understanding products better !

For oily skin and brightening, look for something with Niacinamide (vitamin B3)"

1593353135.0,1,La roche posay's toner for oily skin or the other blue bottle the normal one
1593355030.0,1,Naruko magnolia toner!! It‚Äôs FA safe and has a lot of niacinamide in it which is reallyyy good for fading hyperpigmentation
1593359626.0,1,"Suhada Urea Lotion is my fungal acne safe HG.  It is often recommended for dry skin but urea is part of our skin's barrier and good for all skin types!  For acid toners, my favorite non-AB one is Tarte Knockout Tingling treatment, it has lactic and salicylic acid as well as niacinamide and is fungal acne safe.  Really good for scarring and hyperpigmentation IMO!"
1593366784.0,1,"Hydrating Toner: alcohol free (think Asian hydrating toners)

You need to **choose only 1 toner** however I will give you several of my recommendations to choose from below.

Some examples that I like are:

Naturie Hatomugi Skin Conditioner

Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner

SECRET KEY Starting Treatment Essence

LJH Dr's Cosmetic Bio beauty water Facial toner

Pyunkang Yul Mist Toner

Merlot hydrating toner (American brand)

Heritage Store Rosewater + glycerin

Pure Rosewater"

1593312044.0,5,so glad to hear it!! It‚Äôs an absolute HG for me as well!! I definitely will be looking into trying some of their other products haha
1593345434.0,1,"I think I might go w that one then but my prob is I heard about instree/innisfree and idk which ones best for scarring, hyperpigmentation, oily skin, and fungal acne. (Plus my skin on my face is much darker than the rest of my body)"
1593372687.0,1,So did the hyperpigmentation die down?
1593327406.0,2,that‚Äôs so unfortunate!! Sad to hear that it didn‚Äôt work out :((
1593463306.0,2,"the same thing happened to me, I have oily/combination skin as well. I found it to gave me white heads and my skin just looked blotchy after using it, super disappoint since now I have a whole bottle I don‚Äôt know what to do with."
1593327340.0,12,"haha ofc, I use it both am (right after cleansing and before moisturizer/spf) and pm (after tret, then pyunkang, then moisturizer). I always apply it to a slightly damp face in layers. The first layer I just put 1-2 drops of the slightly viscous formula and pat it gently into my face. I repeat 2-3 times depending on how much moisture I need at the time. I have combo skin with an oily, acne prone t-zone and cheeks with dry patches. Since I‚Äôm also on tret, this toner helped hydrate my skin barrier when it was compromised. My skin was red, stinging like crazy when anything was applied and I got random blotches of red on my skin after washing my face. This toner has a slightly viscous texture and absorbs well into my skin without feeling heavy. It definitely can be used for the ‚Äú7 skins‚Äù method! In addition, the product is from the pyunkang oriental medicine clinic in south korea and they emphasize using basic, simple no fuss ingredients based on traditional medicine. The essence toner only has 7 ingredients and I believe like 91.3 of it is like milk vetch (astragalus root) extract which has foundations in traditional Chinese medicine and is known for soothing skin, warming up skin circulation and reducing irritation/redness. but ofc as always ymmv!! Hope this helped :))"
1593340611.0,2,"HL stands for Hada Labo, theyre a fantastic brand.
Yes, this toner is thick and serumy, it's very hydration based and plumping. I use the skinlex one for the niacinamide and I like to mix the two to dilute it sometimes. I use them both though, and they're hg"
1593346317.0,1,Do they have it on Amazon in your area? I think hada Labo products there are reputable
1593352785.0,1,"Yeah, the serum has glucosamine so it boosts the effect of niacinamide. It also has licorice extract.
Both do the job ig, but I wish skinlex were could ship to more places too :(("
1593313791.0,8,The light version has Polysorbate 20 which is supposedly not FA safe.
1593353971.0,1,Ohh thanks for pointing that out. I didn't realise cause it didn't trigger fungal acne for me
1593409973.0,2,"Oh crap, I didn't know! It's never exacerbated mine, but of course YMMV. Thanks for the heads up!"
1593376188.0,1,"Just out of curiosity, why is it not FA safe?"
1593350275.0,1,"That's strange, I have very oily skin and haven't found it to be sticky or foaming in the slightest. Not something i've seen on reviews I've scoured before purchasing either but YMMV"
1593338395.0,1,"Well yes, but why? Too irritating? Too mild? Doesn't like the consistency/ application? Etc"
1593375361.0,1,Ah didn‚Äôt know! Thank you!
1593348136.0,1,"I haven't tried the Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner personally, but have heard good things. I use the Green Tea toner in the morning and the EH Relief Toner at night but I don't think it makes too much difference. I've just bought the COSRX Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream. It's pretty hard finding a good moisturiser for oily acne prone skin!"
1593373528.0,1,I can't say for sure because I use other brightening products in conjunction for better effects.  I have a synergistic effect of several products to be the most effective for me.
1593423447.0,1,"Well I have consistent acne that I'm trying to fix (hormones can be brutal), so I still get new spots, but they definitely seem to go away faster than they have before."
1593345506.0,1,Would u suggest for me to get tret? And if I‚Äôm going to incorporate serums like niacinamide would that go after the toner or before?
1593341585.0,3,Just to clarify - is the HL premium toner the one in the yellow bottle? Thank you :)
1593346359.0,2,Yea there‚Äôs amazon in my area but I don‚Äôt use amazon.com I use amazon.ae and they rlly do up the price

1593350543.0,1,Yeah I bought the actual authentic one from the store itself but for some reason niacinamide and the √©tude house had the habit of foaming on my face
1593349679.0,1,Yeah I‚Äôm considering to buy the cerave moisturizing lotion
1593359995.0,2,"what are your skin problems? Tret is like the gold standard-it can help with acne, hyperpigmentation, anti-aging, smoothing our texture, cell regeneration etc (but make sure to wear spf during the day as it makes it your skin more sensitive). Niacinamide is supposed to help with reducing sebum production (less oils, hyperpigmentation, less redness and acne. Both is good, but if you want to start out with something that is slightly lighter (tret usage may be accompanied with a purge and takes longer to see the  effects), I would suggest applying niacinamide after cleansing and toner but before moisturizer (so cleanse, toner/essence, niacinamide, moisturizer). For tretinoin you are supposed to buffer so after cleansing wait 10-15 minutes for your face to dry, then put on tret and hang out for like 30 minutes, then wet face with damp hands and put on the rest of your routine. By the way, putting toner/essence on a slightly damp face really helps lock in the moisture into your skin barrier much better than if you were to put it on dry skin"
1593342329.0,2,Yep! The yellow orange gradient!
1593812232.0,1,Thank you all for responding! My little sister has FA and I wanted to know which products she should avoid
1593355446.0,1,Are you using TO niacinamide? I use the soonjung toner with PC 10% niacinamide and no roaming issues.
1593355672.0,1,Becareful with this moisturizer. I recently bought it and thought it would be better bang for my buck but my gosh I instantly felt a flush and itchy feeling. I ignored it and went along my day but the slight flush and once a while itchiness lasted on and off all day until I washed it off. And the following day I got 4 juicy cyst.

1593355816.0,1,I think it‚Äôs the way im applying it
1593355777.0,1,Any suggestions for what moisturizer I could get?
1593363998.0,1,not ab product but I heard the ordinary niacinamide serum is fungal acne safe!
1593356274.0,1,Yeah using TO niacinamide foams if you don‚Äôt want for in between steps to absorb. I would still try the soonjung toner because it has really good soothing ingredients.
1593355933.0,1,I‚Äôve been using cerave pm (old formula) and just ordered the new formula hopefully it won‚Äôt break me out. But I‚Äôve been testing vanicream lite lotion. And my skin has not reacted negatively to it so far. I‚Äôm still in the process of patch testing. I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt break me out because it actually absorbs really nicely into the skin.
1593366370.0,1,Heard great things about COSRX Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream but waiting for mine to arrive .
1593356597.0,1,Yeah but the soonjung foamed too

If I'm just staying in for the day (which has been practically every day for months on end at this point) then I layer the Ceramidin liquid with the Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment. My redness has gone down so much that I will Zoom with only the Color Correcting Treatment on and no makeup! My skin has never looked so healthy."
1593401762.0,2,I switched my toner and moisturiser to Commleaf Skin Relief (Centella asiatica concentration) when I was experiencing unusual redness and dehydration a couple of weeks ago and it‚Äôs been great since.

I would also throw the [Purito Centella Unscented Serum](https://m.puritoen.com/product/purito-centella-unscented-serum/57/) and [Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Serum](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/keep-cool-soothe-bamboo-serum-50ml/1556066839/) as recommendations to check out.

OP, like you, I am layering the LRP Cicaplast at night. I usually put on 3 separate layers spaced out by 30 minute intervals and add a few drops of rosehip oil at the end to seal the deal. It‚Äôs probably overkill (and my face is completely white by then) but I wake up with skin that is no longer irritated.

Also, I don‚Äôt know where you live, but I‚Äôm in a sunny area and I‚Äôm religious about reapplying sunscreen every 2 hours. (Again, it might be overkill, but I‚Äôm on tret so I get burned easily.)"
1593415969.0,1,How do you like the gel? I've been considering buying it for a while now. Does it sink in quickly?

Which rosehip oil do you use? I really want to introduce an oil but I'm not sure which one to try. I tested the PAI rosehip oil last year and my skin absolutely freaked out! This brand is supposedly designed for sensitive / red skin as well."

1593457982.0,2,My redness is way less noticeable after using those two mugwort products although I find the Missha essence isn't very hydrating so still need to use a hydrating toner/essence as well. YMMV of course: I've tried so many redness reducing products as I'm so self-conscious about it but mostly been left disappointed.
1593437637.0,1,"Yeah, it ended up making my face very red after using it for a while"
1593441182.0,2,"I‚Äôve used the Purito sunscreen; it gets rave reviews here but it‚Äôs kind of just okay for me. It feels like a lotion when applied but it is not waterproof, so don‚Äôt apply it anywhere near your eyes! The Innisfree Daily Defense is a good alternative as it also has centella.

For rosehip oil, I‚Äôve always used TO bc it‚Äôs cheap and I can get it easily from Sephora. I‚Äôve used it for years with no problem (just 2-3 drops at the end of the PM routine). Some people do experience reactions though. You may be able to try another oil that your skin accepts, such as jojoba. YMMV!"

So I still use Etude House Oh My Eye liner. It is a brush in a well so you can get a thick dark line. Yes, it can crack as the day wears on but I can accept that. It‚Äôs inexpensive, doesn‚Äôt give you raccoon eyes (smudge or smear), and lasts all day."

The gray liner is really good, especially on minimal makeup days such as beach days. I usually just apply SPF, pat on a bit of loose powder to hide the shine from the sunscreen and swipe the gray liner on to give depth to the eyes and I'm good.

Also, for people with shakey hands like mine, they don't leave the blob of liner like some other brands."

1593448711.0,2,"Hi, I‚Äôm from Germany too and just wanna let you know that you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about customs!

I‚Äôve had 4 orders delivered from yesstyle during the pandemic; 2 around 50‚Ç¨, 2 around 80‚Ç¨. NONE of it got stuck in customs! 

Yesstyle writes something like ‚Äúscarf, value 16‚Ç¨‚Äù (was actually 2 shirts and 4 lipsticks) for small packages and ‚Äúshoes, value 18‚Ç¨‚Äù (was actually 5 shirts, 4 lipsticks and a primer) for bigger packages. Basically they undervalue it so you won‚Äôt have to come in and open it for customs bcs it‚Äôs over the 22‚Ç¨ limit. 

Just don‚Äôt buy like 30 items at once so the package doesn‚Äôt get too big and obvious, and it‚Äôll most likely be at your doorstep in two weeks without being caught in customs!

Also, IF any of your orders ever land in customs, yesstyle says they‚Äôll refund you the customs tax excluding the holding fee in store credit."

I‚Äôve had to pay customs twice, and they did reimburse me the customs fee but not the ‚Ç¨10 handling charge.

1593426438.0,1,"Thanks for your comment!

No I haven‚Äôt ordered from yesstyle yet, but I‚Äôve had to deal with our customs office here before, and seriously this was no fun. It‚Äôs not a place I‚Äôd like to go again, particularly not with the extra hassle due to the whole COVID situation. 

I‚Äôd generally be fine with paying some taxes, if it wasn‚Äôt such an annoying process. This is really the only reason that keeps me from ordering directly from yesstyle. The markups in EU based stores can be really huge, that‚Äôs true."

I‚Äôm in Belgium, by the way."
1593514249.0,1,"Lol ok Good to know üòÇ

So you never even had to pay turnover tax on imports?

Were the packages of a kind of ‚Äûbelievable‚Äú size and weight?

I guess if it gets too big and heavy, that might be a little suspicious..."
1593515139.0,1,"I‚Äôve had my run ins with customs for packages from other shops (BTS merch from Weverse ALWAYS lands in customs üôÑ), but the yesstyle stuff always came with NO additional costs, dropped off like a normal package within Germany would.

The packages are typically on the smaller side and with very plain packaging, so it‚Äôs believable that it‚Äôs actually just a cheap item off amazon or something of the sort.

I wouldn‚Äôt do more than 5 bigger/bulkier items (like clothing) per order to be safe with the package size. I‚Äôm always worried for nothing tho, all my orders so far were packed tightly that it looked as if it was way less than it actually was."

1593402838.0,3,"The only ones I've tried on your list are Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Mask and CosRx Snail Essence. I've also used the Etude House Soon Jung toner, not Emulsion.

The Purito is nice, but very very lightweight. I don't think it's very occlusive.

I hated the CosRx Snail Essence because it's not hydrating, plus I hate the slimy goopy consistency. If you want a snail product in your routine, I would recommend the CosRx Snail AIO Cream. Ignore the word cream, it's more of a ""whipped essence,"" if you will, mostly a humectant. Snail doesn't do much for me personally so I've stopped using it, but the CosRx Snail AIO is definitely the best snail product I ever tried. It's actually hydrating and absorbent unlike the Essence. And not sticky.

Here are the products I swear by in my Tretinoin routine:

Cleansing Oil: Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil

Cleanser: Heimish All Clean Green Foam

Essence: Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Essence

Toner: Keep Cool and Soothe Bamboo Toner, 2sol Cica Youth Toner. I also love Benton Deep Green Tea Toner, but do be aware that it's much less hydrating than 2sol, which is the most hydrating of the 3. It's also less hydrating than Keep Cool.  But I still love it. I'd say it's on ""hydration par"" with Soon Jung toner, but I prefer it to SJ

Serum: Dr. Ceuracle Propolis 33 Ampoule

Moisturizers: 

AM or PM: Curel Intensive Moisture Cream. AMAZING lightweight moisture bomb. So reparative (pseudoceramides)

PM only: Zeroid Intensive Oint Cream, Olivarrier Emollient Extra Comfort Cream (neither is as moisturizing as my HG La Roche Posay Lipikar Balm (non AB) but still good.)

La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume is unbeatable for irritation/inflammation and repair. Unbeatable, I tell you! üòã I don't know what kind of magic is in it. I think it's a ""more than the sum of its parts"" situation. I tried the Etude House Soon Jung Balm as an alternative because it has similar ingredients but it just wasn't as good.

Every single one of these products is fragrance free. All are focused on soothing, hydrating and moisturizing."
1593404742.0,2,"Purito cleanser is really good and gentle. While I like the Isntree essence, it's just a nice light non sticky gel serum for daytime IMO."
1593405482.0,2,"Consider buffering your tretinoin by mixing it with a basic moisturizer.


Cleanser: Innisfree is quite drying for me, while friends say Purito is a gentler version of Cosrx Low pH.

1593490598.0,1,"It wasn't as occlusive/protective or redness reducing. I think that the Cicaplast is so good because of the mineral components (zinc, copper and manganese.) The Soon Jung doesn't contain those iirc. But the Soon Jung is more lightweight and elegant so there's that."
1593486774.0,1,"I keep things really simple in my Tretinoin routine. The less products the better. I feel like every product dilutes the Tretinoin a bit.

1593490482.0,1,"I don't wait because I've been on Tretinoin for 6 years. But if you're new to Tretinoin you are supposed to wait for the skin to be completely dry before applying because damp skin is more absorbent/permeable, which can cause a lot of irritation."

1593316520.0,2,"Too Cool For School Egg Mousse pack! :) I love it! It comes in a 150ml pump aerosol type of bottle, and trust me it is WORTH EVERY PENNY! 

I use it once or twice a week. A little goes a long way, as I actually used this product religiously and it lasted me about a year! 

My friends and I would have sleepovers and I'd give them some to try, and they all love it! It really makes your skin glow after, and your pores miraculously shrunk upon use! It sounds crazy, but it's true.. my friends all bought their own egg mousse packs after trying out mine! :)"

1593333398.0,3,Well I'm skeptical because pores can't shrink hahah but I've been curious about that brand because they have a pumpkin mask and I wonder it would work the same as a nonab very expensive mask I've tried

1593292903.0,5,YesStyle and a couple others have the mini sample sizes for purchase! I think it was $7
1593291712.0,8,"I understand, it is definitely pricier than other AB products. I will say that you get a lot for the price and that it lasts a long time, if you did want to invest in it in the future. A different kind of mask that‚Äôs cheaper that I‚Äôve also liked is the Skinfood strawberry black sugar mask, I think that the brand/that particular mask might be in the process of being discontinued, but they still sell some versions of it, like the black sugar honey mask, it‚Äôs at Ulta online and also Jolse for about $10. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend scrubbing your face with it really, but if you gently rub it in and then let it set it‚Äôs pretty nice"
1593380866.0,1,"I am always singing the praises of the I'm From Ginseng Mask! I agree, it's the most brightening, hydrating mask I've ever tried. I was actually pretty underwhelmed by the I'm From Honey Mask, which I guess goes to show that YMMV."
1593324812.0,3,i have oily acne-prone skin which mask would you recommend (just one) i also have a bit of redness and pih if that helps! the honey one sounds amazing from your description
1593348542.0,1,"It does have scent. I‚Äôm sensitive to smells and find it a little strong at first, but I feel like the scent fades away as you wear it. Or I‚Äôm just getting used to it lol"
1593314987.0,8,"Thanks for asking, I'm sorry I didn't clarify this earlier. 
I've tried the Vitamin Tea Tree and Ginseng rinse-off masks. I've also sampled the Rice, Honey, Volcanic Clay and Mugwort masks. 

For reference I used to have dehydrated combination skin and aggressive acne, but after Accutane my skin is now dry and dehydrated. 

IMO: 
Honey mask: best for non-oily skin, since it leaves a layer of film on top the skin after watching which has been described as unpleasant

Volcanic clay: Every skin type could benefit from this. Great at removing sebum and a great gentle exfoliant- skin is very smooth and free of debris after

Mugwort: super calming, this is one of I'm From's most popular rinse-offs. Very calming, and definitely does reduce redness, pigmentation. I'd all skin types would enjoy this. 

Rice: perhaps not oily and combination, since there is something like a waxy residue left behind. 

Vitamin tea tree: All skin types; Gothamista recommends oily skin types keep it on for longer (up to 30 minutes) and as someone who wore it previously with oily skin and now with dry skin I can say this is great for everyone. Skin looks seriously brighter, you can't see my pores anymore. Got to brave yourself the first few minutes of the fermented smell of the mask though- I think it's almost 70% vitamin tea tree leaf, but the results are fabulous!"
1593349724.0,6,They're both really nice! The clay one is quite creamy and has little mugwort leaf pieces in it for kind of a gentle exfoliation (super gentle). The rose one is similar to the Fresh rose mask if you've ever tried that. A cooling jelly/gel texture with rose petals in it.
1593367887.0,1,"Which did you order? I love the clay one for summer since I get super oily and it helps keep my pores clear... but is pretty gentle for a clay mask, doesn't dry too tight. The rose one is great all year round. Just generally calming and cooling."
1593321705.0,6,"I once awarded somebody platinum with my butt. It was so awkward, it was just a normal regular ass comment."
1593303095.0,3,Same üòÇ
1593365777.0,1,"Oops! Hahah thanks for letting me know! I just realised pores can't shrink :') This product does help make pores appear smaller. I find that after every use, my skin glows and looks smoother. You should definitely give this product a try! I am currently on my third bottle of mousse pack now, I seriously swear by this product! I also like how its all foamy when you put on your face, and then the foam will start to fade.. which is like an indication you should wash the mask off (it makes your skincare routine fun too!).

Personally, I have never used their pumpkin mask before, but so far all products I've tried from Too Cool For School have been amazing! They're slightly expensive, but their products are quality! 

If you're interested in trying other products from Too Cool For School, I'd also recommend the egg cream mask (the smell is amazing, plus it really hydrates my skin during cold winter months!), their Artclass by Rodin range (I love the contouring one and the highlighter), their Dinoplatz lip balms (no joke one of the best lip balms/glosses I've ever tried! After trying 1 of their colours, I fell in love and bought 3 more different colours!). I've never tried any from the pumpkin range before, but I've heard many good reviews about them too. So yea you should definitely give this brand a go! You won't regret it! :)"

1593292888.0,3,"There is a mini version I might try that first and see if I like it enough to get the fullsize, was looking at the skinfood ones too so I might try to snag them before they disappear"
1593399129.0,2,PLEASE say they aren't actually discontinuing the strawberry one. I still get mine off amazon but I think my heart will break in two if they stop selling it.
1593324921.0,3,I also have oily acne prone skin and i would say the honey mask gave me better results and worked more for my skin
1593324915.0,1,oh i can‚Äôt decide between vit tea tree and mugwort! both sounds amazing
1593332733.0,1,This is very helpful thank you! I'm quite oily/acne prone so the mugwort one was my first choice. But I've ordered other mugwort products for calming so would like something different to try for a mask and the vitamin tree mask is very tempting
1593655154.0,1,Thanks for your review üòâ
1593368272.0,1,The mugwort one! I have a bit of acne and wondering if it‚Äôll help with that
1593374338.0,2,"If it plumps your skin, it can give that effect though! Pores aren't muscles however."
1593295582.0,3,Welcome! Mine lasted me 5 uses so def worth it!
1593402911.0,1,"My main source of info is from past threads on here, the last thing I had heard about Skinfood in general is that the company might shut down. Threads like this sum it up though, at a point no one knew https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/9mo53v/end_of_skinfood_according_to_skinfood_gangnam/

But then I searched it now and saw this- https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/b6e1rr/news_skinfood_is_back/ So it seems like they might be fine. For me the strawberry mask used to be available online on at Ulta and Yesstyle but it‚Äôs currently gone from both, so I thought it might be in the process of being discontinued. Based on the thread about them being back though and their official site having it, now I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre probably doing okay"
1593325527.0,2,"I personally recommend the Vitamin Tea Tree one first. Both are in huge 120g jars, and using it 2-3x a week you can last months on one.

Happy skincare!"
1593336765.0,3,"Not going to lie, it's not the cheapest but a 120g jar is going to last you for at least 3 months; I use it 2-3 times a week (4x/weekly on holiday and I want to max out my skin's nourishment and health without stress) and it really is quite cheap per use compared to sheet masking. 

If your skin is anything like mine, you'll be amazed at how the sebum filaments in pores just disappear, how your skin will have this 'lit within' inner glow and feel so even and texturally smooth. 

Best of luck!"
1593303507.0,4,Seconding the I‚Äôm From range. I have the mugwort one and it‚Äôs divine.
1593406458.0,1,Oh thank god. I'm glad they're just trying for focus on domestic sales and favorites. Maybe they'll come back to US selling at some point.
1593325756.0,1,may i ask why you would choose that first?
1593317748.0,2,"Hello, this is my first review.

Skin type: oily-combo

So I bought this face mask off Yesstyle after watching one of Hyram‚Äôs videos. I have used it a couple of times after I wash my face. Directions say to leave it on for 5-10 mins so I usually leave it for 10 mins. The texture is kind of slimy with real small pieces of mugwort, but I use the white paddle to spread it on my face. This mask does smell kind of bad, probably due to the natural smell of mugworts. When washing the face mask off with warm water, you will definitely feel the slimy texture which sticks to your face so it takes some time to fully wash the whole mask off. After washing it off though, I notice my face looks and feels a lot softer. The mask was also not irritating to my skin."
1593414802.0,1,Hi! Thanks for this. How long did it take for your order to arrive?
1593416268.0,2,"I live in the US and it took the package to arrive in 8 days, but I spent enough on yesstyle to get express shipping which they say takes 5-7 business days and all the items that I bought had a maximum of 3-5 days processing time."
1593416494.0,1,Great! I live in the US too...did you pay any custom duty? I have been wanting to order stuff from YesStyle but always back out due to customs and their shipping times.
1593417050.0,2,"I did not have to pay any custom duty and I have ordered numerous times from them before and I never had to pay customs fees. And if you plan to order from Yesstyle soon, they have an extra 12% off code on their website (SUMMER2020) which you can use but I don‚Äôt know when the code expires. I also recommend making sure all the items in your cart have short processing times or else your order can take longer to arrive."
